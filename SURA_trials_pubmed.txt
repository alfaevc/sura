TI  - Training penguins to interact with enrichment devices for lasting effects.
PG  - 481-489
LID - 10.1002/zoo.21510 [doi]
AB  - The modern zoo has brought about two major advances in the behavioral welfare of 
      their exhibited animals: (a) The use of environmental enrichment to promote
      naturalistic behaviors and (b) the use of training to improve voluntary husbandry
      care. Whereas training itself has been talked about as an effective enrichment
      strategy, little has been done to combine training procedures with enrichment.
      Typically, enrichment is treated as a trial and error process, where potential
      enrichment items or procedures are cycled through until successful enrichment is 
      found. The use of shaping or other training techniques has seldom been documented
      to increase engagement with possible enrichment items or procedures. The
      following study examined the possibility of combining training and enrichment to 
      produce continued interactions with enrichment devices. Two species of penguin,
      Magellanic and southern rockhopper penguins, were studied. Two measures were
      taken: Time spent swimming and contact with enrichment devices. The enrichment
      devices could be manipulated by placing fish within and hanging out of each
      device. During baseline sessions, no hits to either device were observed. During 
      training sessions, several hits were recorded when fish were in the devices and
      overall swimming time increased during these conditions. When baseline was
      reintroduced without fish in the devices, contact with the enrichment devices
      rapidly declined and swimming time for the rockhopper penguins decreased. When
      the devices were reintroduced with fish but without training, the greatest number
      of enrichment device contacts and the highest percentage of time spent swimming
      were observed for the rockhopper penguins.

TI  - Behavior Change Interventions Delivered through Interpersonal Communication,
      Agricultural Activities, Community Mobilization, and Mass Media Increase
      Complementary Feeding Practices and Reduce Child Stunting in Ethiopia.
PG  - 1470-1481
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxz087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate infant and young child feeding practices are critical for
      optimal child growth and development, but in Ethiopia, complementary feeding (CF)
      practices are very poor. Alive & Thrive (A&T) provided intensive behavior change 
      interventions through 4 platforms: interpersonal communication (IPC),
      nutrition-sensitive agricultural activities (AG), community mobilization (CM),
      and mass media (MM). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact
      of A&T intensive compared with nonintensive interventions (standard nutrition
      counseling and agricultural extension service and less intensive CM and MM) on CF
      practices and knowledge and child anthropometric outcomes. METHODS: We used a
      cluster-randomized evaluation design with cross-sectional surveys among
      households with children aged 6-23.9 mo [n = 2646 at baseline (2015) and n = 2720
      at endline (2017)]. We derived difference-in-difference impact estimates (DDEs)
      and conducted dose-response and path analyses to document plausibility of
      impacts. RESULTS: At endline, exposure to IPC was 17.8-32.3%, exposure to AG was 
      22.7-36.0%, exposure to CM was 18.6-54.3%, and exposure to MM was 35.4% in the
      intensive group. Minimum dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet increased 
      significantly in the intensive group but remained low at endline (24.9% and
      18.2%, respectively). Significant differential declines in stunting prevalence
      were observed (DDE: -5.6 percentage points; P < 0.05) in children aged 6-23.9 mo,
      decreasing from 36.3% to 22.8% in the intensive group. Dose-response analyses
      showed higher odds of minimum dietary diversity (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 2.2, 4.8) and
      minimum meal frequency (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.6) and higher height-for-age z
      score (HAZ) (beta: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.4) among women exposed to 3 or 4
      platforms. Path analyses showed a strong relation between AG and egg consumption,
      which led to increased child dietary diversity and HAZ. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of 
      social and behavior change interventions using multiple platforms was feasible
      and effective, resulting in improvements in CF practices and child stunting
      within a 2-y period. There is a need for continued efforts, however, to expand
      intervention coverage and to improve CF practices in Ethiopia. This trial was
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02775552.

TI  - Using Food Models to Enhance Sugar Literacy among Older Adolescents: Evaluation
      of a Brief Experiential Nutrition Education Intervention.
LID - E1763 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu11081763 [doi]
AB  - Adolescent diets high in sugar are a public health concern. Sugar literacy
      interventions have changed intake but focused more on children, adults, and early
      adolescents and on sugar sweetened beverages rather than total sugar consumption.
      Food models are an efficacious experiential learning strategy with children. This
      study assessed the impact of two 45 min nutrition lessons using food models on
      adolescents' sugar literacy. Classes (n = 16) were randomized to intervention or 
      control with knowledge, label reading skills, intentions to limit sugar
      consumption measured at baseline and follow-up. Two hundred and three students
      aged 14 to 19 from six schools on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada participated in
      the study. Adolescents' knowledge of added sugar in foods and beverages and
      servings per food group in a healthy diet was limited at baseline but improved
      significantly in the intervention condition (F(1, 201) = 104.84, p < 0.001)
      compared to controls. Intention to consume less added sugar increased
      significantly after intervention (F(1, 201) = 4.93, p = 0.03) as did label
      reading confidence (F(1, 200) = 14.94, p < 0.001). A brief experiential learning 
      intervention using food models was efficacious for changing student's knowledge
      about sugar guidelines and sugar in food, label reading confidence, and intention
      to change sugar consumption.

TI  - Effects of postprandial hydroxytyrosol and derivates on oxidation of LDL,
      cardiometabolic state and gene expression: a nutrigenomic approach for
      cardiovascular prevention.
PG  - 419-426
LID - 10.2459/JCM.0000000000000816 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most frequent causes
      of death in the world. Inflammation and oxidative damage contribute significantly
      to the development of atherosclerosis and CVDs. European Food Safety Authority
      scientific opinion has acknowledged that hydroxytyrosol
      (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol) and derivatives, contained in extra virgin olive oil
      (EVOO), typically used in Mediterranean diet may play a crucial role in the
      reduction of the inflammatory pathway and in the prevention of CVDs. The aim of
      the study was to determine the effect in healthy volunteers of 25 g of
      phenols-rich EVOO (p-EVOO). METHODS: The clinical study was a randomized,
      controlled trial to determine the acute effect in the postprandial time of 25 g
      of p-EVOO. We evaluated nutritional status using anthropometric parameters, body 
      composition, serum metabolites, oxidative stress biomarkers and gene expression
      of eight genes related to oxidative stress and human inflammasome pathways,
      lasting 2 h after p-EVOO administration. Twenty-two participants resulted as
      eligible for the study. RESULTS: A significant reduction of oxidized LDL,
      malondialdehyde, triglycerides and visceral adiposity index was highlighted (P < 
      0.05). Significant upregulation of catalase, superoxide dismutase 1 and upstream 
      transcription factor 1 were observed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current study
      shows that intake of 25 g of p-EVOO has been able to be modulated, in the
      postprandial time, the antioxidant profile and the expression of inflammation and
      oxidative stress-related genes, as superoxide dismutase 1, upstream transcription
      factor 1 and catalase. We also observed a significant reduction of oxidized LDL, 
      malondialdehyde, triglycerides and visceral adiposity index. We have demonstrated
      that a daily intake of phenols and antioxidants can reduce the inflammatory
      pathway and oxidative stress and therefore the risk of atherosclerosis and CVDs. 
      More studies on a larger population are necessary before definitive conclusions
      can be drawn.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01890070.

TI  - Is atopy a risk indicator of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in dairy
      farmers?
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s12931-019-1082-2 [doi]
AB  - Allergic mechanisms related to environmental and occupational exposure have been 
      suggested to contribute to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationships between atopy
      markers, persistent airflow limitation (PAL) and occupational exposure in dairy
      farmers. METHODS: Clinical and biological (total IgE and 21 allergen specific
      IgE) markers of atopy were assessed in 101 dairy farmers with PAL (DF-PAL), 85
      non-farmers with PAL (NF-PAL) (both groups were prospectively included from a
      screening program performed between 2011 and 2015), and matched controls, i.e. 98
      farmers without PAL (DF-controls) and 89 non-farming subjects without PAL
      (NF-controls). Occupational exposure in farmers was estimated using a validated
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Prevalence of allergy history was significantly higher in
      DF-PAL and in NF-PAL than in controls. Polysensitization, and sensitization to
      seasonal and food allergens were more frequent in DF-PAL than in DF-controls,
      respectively: 13.8% vs 1% (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 17.5 (2.2-134), 11.9% vs
      3.1% (aOR: 4.4 (1.2-7.2) and 16.8% vs 4.1% (aOR: 5.2 (1.7-7.2)). The prevalence
      of atopy markers was similar between NF-PAL patients and NF-controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: PAL in farmers is associated with a high rate of markers of atopy,
      supporting atopy as a risk indicator. Clinical trial registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02540408).

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effect of treating cows with teat
      sealant only compared with antibiotic plus teat sealant at drying off on weekly
      somatic cell count, potential intramammary infection, and milk production across 
      the entire subsequent lactation. In 3 research herds in the south of Ireland,
      cows with SCC that did not exceed 200,000 cells/mL in the previous lactation
      (LowSCC) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments at drying off: internal teat
      sealant alone (ITS) or antibiotic plus teat sealant (AB+ITS). Cows with SCC that 
      exceeded 200,000 cells/mL in the previous lactation were treated with AB+ITS and 
      included in the analyses as a separate group (HighSCC). Weekly individual animal 
      composite SCC records were available for 654 cow lactations and were transformed 
      to somatic cell scores (SCS) for the purpose of analysis. Data were divided into 
      3 data sets to represent records obtained (1) up to 35 DIM, (2) up to 120 DIM,
      and (3) across the lactation. Foremilk secretions were taken from all quarters at
      drying off, at calving, 2 wk after calving, and in mid-lactation and were
      cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. The LowSCC cows treated with ITS
      alone had higher daily milk yield (0.67 kg/d) across lactation compared with
      LowSCC cows treated with AB+ITS. The LowSCC cows treated with ITS alone had
      higher SCS in early, up to mid, and across lactation compared with LowSCC cows
      treated with AB+ITS. We detected no difference in weekly SCS of LowSCC cows
      treated with ITS alone and SCS of HighSCC cows. The least squares means
      back-transformed SCC across lactation of the LowSCC cows treated with ITS alone, 
      LowSCC cows treated with AB+ITS, and HighSCC cows were 41,523, 34,001, and 38,939
      cells/mL respectively. The odds of LowSCC cows treated with ITS alone having
      bacteria present in their foremilk across lactation was 2.7 (95% confidence
      interval: 1.91 to 3.85) and 1.6 (1.22 to 2.03) times the odds of LowSCC cows
      treated with AB+ITS and of HighSCC cows treated with AB+ITS, respectively. In
      this study, Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent pathogen isolated from
      the population. Recategorizing the threshold for LowSCC cows as </=150,000
      cells/mL or </=100,000 cells/mL in the previous lactation had no effect on the
      results. The results indicate that herds with good mastitis control programs may 
      use ITS alone at dry-off in cows with SCC <200,000 cells/mL across lactation with
      only a small effect on herd SCC.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of nutrition education on improving knowledge,
      attitude, and practice (KAP) of mothers and the improvement of the nutritional
      status of their children. A cluster randomized controlled design using multistage
      sampling was employed. The integrated school-based nutrition programme included
      gardening, nutrition education for parents, and supplementary feeding for
      children (GarNESup). KAP of mothers was assessed using pretested questionnaires
      administered by teachers. The randomly selected schools were randomly allocated
      into two groups: Both schools provided lunch to targeted children with one-dish
      indigenous vegetable recipe, but School 1 received iron-fortified rice whereas
      School 2 was provided ordinary rice. Eighty wasted and/or anaemic children in
      each school were fed for 120 days. Nutrition education for children's parents was
      done every school card claim day and during parent-teacher meetings using 10
      developed modules. Weight, height, and haemoglobin level of children and KAP of
      mothers were measured at baseline and endpoint using standard techniques. KAP of 
      mothers who had completed more than six modules had significantly increased from 
      baseline to endpoint: Negative consequence of worm infestation (33.3% to 60.6%, P
      = 0.035), importance of serving breakfast for children (42.4% to 78.8%, P =
      0.004), cooking vegetables (63.6% to 93.9%, P = 0.002), and purchasing fortified 
      foods was recorded (51.5% to 93.9%, P = 0.000). Children in School 1 had
      significantly higher weight gain (1.33 +/- 0.72) and haemoglobin level (0.49 +/- 
      0.99) than children in School 2 (0.84 +/- 0.59; 0.12 +/- 0.70). Nutrition
      education resulted to significant increase of mother's KAP and the implementation
      of the integrated school-based nutrition model significantly improved children's 
      nutritional status.

TI  - Effect of enhanced homestead food production on anaemia among Cambodian women and
      children: A cluster randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e12757
LID - 10.1111/mcn.12757 [doi]
AB  - There is inconsistent evidence on the efficacy of agriculture programmes at
      improving women and children's anaemia and nutritional status. The primary aim of
      this study was to evaluate the impact of a nutrition-sensitive enhanced homestead
      food production (EHFP) programme on anaemia in women (18-45 years) and children
      (6-59 months) in rural Cambodia. Secondary outcomes were women's micronutrient
      status and women and children's anthropometry. In this cluster-randomized
      controlled trial, 900 households from 90 villages (clusters) were randomized to
      either (a) home gardens and behaviour change communication (BCC) on nutrition,
      hygiene, women's empowerment, and marketing (EHFP); (b) home gardens plus
      fishponds and BCC (EHFP + F); or (c) control (no intervention). Haemoglobin
      concentration and anthropometry were measured in women and children at baseline
      and at 22 months. Venous blood samples were collected in a subset of women (n =
      450) at baseline and at 22 months. Generalized linear mixed effect models with
      repeated measures were used to evaluate the difference across groups and the
      change from baseline to end of study. Ninety clusters, 552 women, and 754
      children completed the trial. Compared with control, we found a statistically
      significant impact on anaemia prevalence in children (-14.0 percentage points; P 
      = 0.02) and retinol binding protein concentrations in women (difference in
      difference: 0.34; P = 0.02) randomized to EHFP and EHFP + F groups, respectively.
      No other statistically significant effects on anaemia, nutritional biomarker
      concentrations, or anthropometry were observed. Future research is needed to
      examine longer term impacts of EHFP on anthropometry in women and children and
      into the nutritional causes of anaemia among children in Cambodia.

      Randomized Controlled Trial on Diabetes Optimal Care Outcomes in Patients with
      Type 2 Diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical care for type 2 diabetes has improved but remains
      suboptimal. Collaborative, team-based models that maximize skills of different
      disciplines may improve care for individuals with diabetes, but few have been
      tested using rigorous research designs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of
      a registered dietitian nutritionist-led telemedicine program compared with that
      of a control group in terms of diabetes optimal care goals. DESIGN: A randomized 
      controlled trial in which participants were assigned to a control or intervention
      group. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: One hundred eighteen adults with type 2 diabetes
      (mean age, 60 years; 45% female) participated in the study between April 2016 and
      December 2017. Participants were recruited from separate primary care clinics in 
      two rural Minnesota communities. INTERVENTION: For those assigned to the
      intervention, registered dietitian nutritionists used a treatment protocol to
      initiate and titrate therapies for blood glucose, hypertension, and lipid levels 
      in addition to providing medical nutrition therapy; telemedicine visits
      supplemented usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included
      composite and individual diabetes optimal care goals: hemoglobin A1c, blood
      pressure, not using tobacco, and taking a statin and aspirin (as appropriate).
      Secondary measures included physical activity, breakfast, fruits and vegetables, 
      whole grains, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, and medication adherence.
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mixed-model regression was used to examine outcomes between
      baseline and 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: A modest but significantly greater
      improvement in the number of diabetes optimal care measures met at follow-up was 
      found in the intervention group (3.7 vs 3.2 in the control group [P=0.017]).
      Among individual measures, the intervention group had significantly greater
      medication use, with 2.5 and 2.2 higher odds (compared with the control group) of
      taking a statin [95% CI, 1.0 to 6.24]) and aspirin [95% CI, 0.90 to 5.19] as
      appropriate, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ENHANCED (diEtitiaNs Helping pAtieNts
      CarE for Diabetes) findings suggest that registered dietitian nutritionists
      following medication treatment protocols can effectively improve care for adults 
      with type 2 diabetes and can serve an instrumental role as part of the health
      care team in providing evidence-based, patient-centered care.

TI  - Study protocol of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial incorporated into the
      Group Lifestyle Balance program: the nutrigenomics, overweight/obesity and weight
      management trial (the NOW trial).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The nutrigenomics, overweight/obesity and weight management trial
      (NOW Trial) is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of community-dwelling
      adults recruited from the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) Program. The GLB Program 
      (formerly referred to as the Diabetes Prevention Program) is an evidence-based,
      intensive weight management program, which was offered to overweight/obese
      patients (BMI >/= 25.0 kg/m(2)) in a rural Ontario community. METHODS: Patients
      enrolled in the GLB Program were invited to participate in this study. GLB groups
      were randomized 1:1 to receive either the standard GLB program + population-based
      lifestyle advice for weight management, or a modified GLB program + personalized,
      genetic-based lifestyle advice for weight management. The purpose of this study
      is to determine if the provision of genetic-based lifestyle guidelines is
      superior to the provision of population-based guidelines in a pragmatic clinical 
      setting to promote changes in: body composition, weight, body mass index, dietary
      and physical activity habits, as well as attitudes, subjective norms, and
      behavioural control. The 12-month intervention protocol consists of 23
      group-based sessions and 4 one-on-one sessions. Data collection time points
      include baseline in addition to 3, 6, and 12-month follow up. The comprehensive
      study design is described in the present manuscript, using both the extended
      CONSORT checklist for reporting pragmatic trials and the SPIRIT checklist as
      guidance during manuscript development. DISCUSSION: Overall, this study seeks to 
      pragmatically determine if the provision of DNA-based lifestyle advice leads to
      improved health and lifestyle outcomes compared to the provision of standard,
      population-based lifestyle advice. The results of this trial can be used to
      inform clinical and community nutrition practice guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      This study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov : NCT03015012 on January 9,
      2017.

TI  - A multicentre randomized controlled trial of food supplement intervention for
      wasting children in Indonesia-study protocol.
PG  - 305
LID - 10.1186/s12889-019-6608-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After the first six months of exclusive breastfeeding, children are
      introduced to liquids and semi-solid food, known as the complementary feeding
      phase. This phase is critical because it is often accompanied by improper feeding
      in children, which may lead to wasting and other nutrition problems. Fortified
      biscuits have been provided for wasting children as a nationwide programme.
      However, the ability of children to accept food supplementation remains
      questionable. This paper describes the protocol of a study investigating the
      efficacy of food supplementation (PMT biscuit) and nutrition education to improve
      the nutritional status of wasting children in Indonesia. METHOD: The efficacy of 
      a government food supplementation programme will be examined using a randomized
      control trial design. Parents with wasting children aged 6-17 months will be
      recruited to participate in the study. After obtaining informed consent and
      pre-intervention measures, participants will be assigned into three arms of
      intervention with PMT biscuits and/or nutrition education only. The two primary
      outcomes for this study are the nutritional status of wasting children and PMT
      biscuit compliance. Characteristics of all subjects in each arm will be analysed 
      and compared with each other to assess their comparability at the beginning. The 
      data will be collected at pre-intervention, at 3 months of intervention,
      post-intervention, and at the 6- to 9-month follow up. DISCUSSION: This paper
      aims to describe the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial
      investigating the effects of different PMT biscuit portion and nutrition
      education in two arms and nutrition education only in another arm. This study is 
      important because it will provide evidence for the Indonesian government
      regarding the efficacy of food supplementation and/or food-based recommendations 
      to improve the nutritional status of wasting children aged 6-23 months in
      Indonesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been registered at
      clinicaltrials.gov, maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the
      National Institutes of Health (NIH), on April 26, 2018, and was last updated on
      April 30, 2018 (registration number: NCT03509155 ).

TI  - Seroprevalence of Q fever among high-risk occupations in the Ilam province, the
      west of Iran.
PG  - e0211781
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0211781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Q fever is a zoonotic disease of great public health importance in
      Iran. This disease is presented with high phase I antibody development in chronic
      and high phase II antibody in the acute form of illness. This study was conducted
      to evaluate the seroprevalence of Q fever among high-risk occupations in the Ilam
      province in Western Iran. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this cross-sectional study,
      367 sera samples were collected from five groups comprised of animal husbandry
      workers, farmers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and park rangers. The
      collected sera were tested for IgG antibodies against Coxiella burnetii using
      ELISA. The seroprevalence of antibodies against C. burnetii in phase I and II was
      24.38% and 26.37%, respectively (i.e., 32.42% overall). Low educational level,
      living in rural areas, keeping sheep/goats, ages older than 50 years, and a
      history of arthropod bites positively correlated with increased risk of Q fever
      infection. Animal husbandry workers (45.13%) were at higher risk of contracting Q
      fever compared with other occupations in the study (17.11%). CONCLUSIONS: High
      seroprevalence of C. burnetii among high-risk occupations is a serious challenge 
      in the Ilam province. In addition, the high seroprevalence of endemic Q fever in 
      rural and nomadic areas and a higher concentration of occupations who are
      directly engaged with livestock demonstrate the critical need for preventive
      medicine education and training in regards to mitigating risk for disease
      contraction in susceptible groups.

AB  - Strategies are needed to help early care and education centers (ECEC) comply with
      policies to meet daily physical activity and fruit and vegetable guidelines for
      young children. This manuscript describes the design and methodology of
      Sustainability via Active Garden Education (SAGE), a 12-session
      cluster-randomized controlled crossover design trial using community-based
      participatory research (CBPR) to test a garden-based ECEC physical activity and
      fruit and vegetables promotion intervention for young children aged 3-5years in
      20 sites. The SAGE curriculum uses the plant lifecycle as a metaphor for human
      development. Children learn how to plant, water, weed, harvest, and do simple
      food preparation involving washing, cleaning, and sampling fruit and vegetables
      along with active learning songs, games, science experiments, mindful eating
      exercises, and interactive discussions to reinforce various healthy lifestyle
      topics. Parents will receive newsletters and text messages linked to the
      curriculum, describing local resources and events, and to remind them about
      activities and assessments. Children will be measured on physical activity,
      height, and weight and observed during meal and snack times to document dietary
      habits. Parents will complete measures about dietary habits outside of the ECEC, 
      parenting practices, home physical activity resources, and home fruit and
      vegetable availability. SAGE fills an important void in the policy literature by 
      employing a participatory strategy to produce a carefully crafted and engaging
      curriculum with the goal of meeting health policy guidelines and educational
      accreditation standards. If successful, SAGE may inform and inspire widespread
      dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities and improve health 
      equity.

TI  - Evaluation of safety and skin tolerability of organic cotton pads in case of
      irritative vulvitis.
PG  - 729-737
LID - 10.23736/S0026-4784.18.04338-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The woman vaginal environment is a fragile and delicate ecosystem
      that is often impaired by physical and chemical agents. This condition tends to
      damage skin barrier causing allergic reactions that lead to chronic irritating
      conditions. METHODS: Clinical and in-vitro studies were performed on organic
      cotton pads in order to assess if their use can prevent the onset of irritant
      conditions. During clinical studies, the panelists' skin and mucosae state were
      checked through a gynecological clinical examination in order to assess tissue
      dryness and alterations. Moreover, each panelist answered a sensorial
      questionnaire at the end of the test. Data were gathered and the product
      acceptability of use was registered in terms of itching, irritations and burning 
      feelings. The panelist score was calculated based on VNS Scale (0-10, where 0 is 
      the minimum value and 10 is the maximum). RESULTS: From a careful analysis of the
      first part of the study, it is possible to state that the tested product (organic
      cotton pads) has proved to reduce the onset of irritative phenomena and slight
      undesired effects caused by the conventional use of synthetic pads. In-vitro
      tests were conducted to study possible biological processes involved during
      allergic and sensitizing events produced by vulvitis. In particular, a
      pro-sensitizing test, a skin irritation on RHE (adapted from OECD 439) and tests 
      to assess the soothing activity were performed on cell substrates. CONCLUSIONS:
      Results demonstrated that organic cotton pads, in each part, are safe and do not 
      impair any physiological activities of the tissue substrates.

AB  - Helminth infections are recognised as a major impediment to the productivity of
      goats in smallholder production systems. We used a multilevel framework to
      estimate the impact that administration of locally available anthelminthic drugs 
      can have on the weight gains of goats in smallholder settings in India and
      Tanzania. We recruited 234 goats from 92 households from Odisha state in India
      and 253 goats from 15 households from Dodoma region in Tanzania. The goats were
      non-pregnant adult females, and from each household a minimum of two goats were
      recruited wherever possible. Each goat was randomly assigned to treatment with a 
      locally available anthelminthic drug, or non-treatment. Each animal was tagged,
      weighed and had its body condition score (BCS) assessed. Animals were followed up
      after 28 and 56 days and re-weighed. To account for the local variations in
      exposure to helminths and for variations between households and herds, the data
      were analysed in a multilevel mixed model with herd in village as nested random
      effects. Over the 56 days of study, the non-treated goats in India had gained a
      mean of 30.64 g per day (a daily gain of 0.23% baseline body weight) and in
      Tanzania 66.01 g per day (0.33% baseline body weight). From the mixed model, the 
      treated goats in India gained a mean of 25.22 g per day more than non-treated
      goats, this is significantly greater than the weight gain in non-treated goats (p
      < 0.001). In Tanzania treated goats gained a mean of 9.878 g per day more than
      non-treated goats, which is also significantly greater than non-treated goats (p 
      = 0.007). Furthermore, in India and Tanzania, goats with a lighter weight at the 
      baseline survey gained greater amounts of weight. In both studies the BCS of the 
      treated goats improved by a greater amount than the non-treated goats. In this
      study we have demonstrated that in certain settings, the administration of
      anthelminthic drugs has a clear beneficial impact on goat weight.

TI  - Enhanced referral prioritisation for acute adult dietetic services: A randomised 
      control trial to test a web-based decision training tool.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietitians in acute adult services need to prioritise dietetic
      referrals in order to manage their daily workload and ensure effective treatment 
      of patients. Newly qualified dietitians do not usually receive specific training 
      on prioritisation and could be helped with an evidence-based, effective,
      decision-training tool that is based on the practice of experienced dietitians.
      We developed an internationally available web-based decision-training tool
      designed to improve novice dietitians' ability to make dietetic prioritisation
      decisions. The training tool comprised of a pre-training task, a post-training
      task and training materials. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness 
      of the training tool on novices' ability for dietetic prioritisation. METHODS:
      Pre-registration dietitians and recent graduates (one-year) from across the UK
      were invited to participate in this randomised controlled trial (RCT). Each
      participant made prioritisation decisions on a set of dietetic referral
      scenarios: 53 scenarios at pre-training and 27 at post-training. After
      pre-training the intervention group was presented with the training materials,
      whereas the control group was told to carry on with the post-training task.
      Participants did not know which group they had been randomly allocated to. We
      calculated i) level of agreement between decisions made by each novice and
      experts' consensus using Pearson correlation, intra-class correlation (ICC(2,1));
      ii) intra-rater consistency using ICC(1,1) and iii) intra-group consistency using
      ICC (2,1). We compared group means at pre-training and post-training; estimated
      effect size using the degree of change from pre- to post-training, and 2-factor
      mixed ANOVA to assess overall effect of the training across the groups and
      time-points. RESULTS: 151 participants (69 in control and 82 in intervention)
      completed the trial. The groups did not differ in demographic characteristics.
      Both Pearson and ICC(2,1) correlations increased with training intervention; a
      moderate effect of training was found for both metrics, d = 0.69 (r = 0.32) for
      the former and d = 0.54 (r = 0.26) for the latter. Intra-rater consistency
      improved with training but with a small effect size, d = 0.32 (r = 0.16). The
      intra-group consistency also improved with training: ICC = 0.48 pre-training to
      0.61 post-training. CONCLUSIONS: The training tool was found to be effective in
      improving the novice dietitian's ability to prioritise referrals in the acute
      adult setting. The training tool is freely available at www.dietitianreferral.org
      for use by all student or early career dietitians internationally.

AB  - A feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of chromium picolinate
      (Cr-Pic) on growth performance, body composition, and biochemical parameters in
      Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. Five experimental diets were formulated with 
      high-protein diet (HP), low-protein diet (LP), and LP + 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg
      kg(-1) Cr, respectively. Each diet was randomly assigned to four replicate groups
      of 30 fish per aquarium in a water-circulated rearing system for 60 days. Dietary
      1.2 or 1.8 mg kg(-1) Cr inclusion significantly affects the final body weight,
      weight gain rate, specific growth rate, feed efficiency rate, and protein
      efficiency ratio of tilapia compare to the LP diet. The Cr inclusion
      significantly decreased the content of blood urea nitrogen and the blood glucose 
      level generally with increasing Cr inclusion levels. The Cr content of gill
      tissue was higher than that of back muscle in all treatments, and the addition of
      1.2 or 1.8 mg kg(-1) Cr significantly enhanced the Cr contents of back muscle.
      The cold stress test results showed that adding Cr significantly enhanced the
      serum T3 concentration and reduced the activity of serum creatine kinase and the 
      serum cortisol level. These results indicated that the supplementation of
      chromium picolinate can improve the growth performance and reshape the serum
      protein and carbohydrate metabolism profile and has the potentiality to alleviate
      the detrimental effects of cold stress in Nile tilapia. The low-protein diet with
      1.8 mg kg(-1) Cr obtained the same growth performance as the high-protein diet.

TI  - Using a Community-Based Early Childhood Development Center as a Platform to
      Promote Production and Consumption Diversity Increases Children's Dietary Intake 
      and Reduces Stunting in Malawi: A Cluster-Randomized Trial.
PG  - 1587-1597
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxy148 [doi]
AB  - Background: Children in Malawi face nutritional risks related to low-quality
      diets and chronic malnutrition. Objective: This study evaluated the impact of a
      1-y early childhood development (ECD) center-based agriculture and nutrition
      intervention aimed at improving household production diversity, maternal
      knowledge on child nutrition and feeding practices, and children's diets and
      anthropometric measures. Methods: A longitudinal cluster-randomized controlled
      trial was implemented in 60 community-based childcare centers (CBCCs), covering
      1248 preschool children (aged 36-72 mo) and 304 younger siblings (aged 6-24 mo). 
      CBCCs were randomly assigned to 1) a control group providing the Save the
      Children's ECD program or 2) a treatment group providing a standard ECD program
      with additional activities to improve nutritious food production and behavior
      change communication to improve diets and care practices for young children.
      Primary outcomes were household production and production diversity, preschooler 
      enrollment and attendance, and dietary intake measured by quantitative 24-h
      recall and minimum diet diversity for younger siblings. Secondary outcomes
      included anthropometric measures for preschoolers and younger siblings, child
      development scores for preschoolers, and women's asset ownership and time use
      (the latter 2 are not discussed in this article). We used
      difference-in-difference (DID) estimates to assess impacts. Results: Compared
      with the control group, preschool children in the intervention group had greater 
      increases in nutrient intakes and in dietary diversity. No impacts on
      anthropometric measures were seen in preschoolers. Younger siblings in the
      intervention group had greater increases in height-for-age z scores than did
      children in the control group (DID: 0.44; P < 0.05) and greater reductions in the
      prevalence of stunting (DID: -17 percentage points; P < 0.05). The plausibility
      of the impact on growth in younger siblings was supported by effects along
      program impact pathways, including production of nutritious foods, caregiver
      knowledge, and dietary diversity. Conclusion: Implementing an integrated
      agriculture and nutrition intervention through an ECD platform benefited
      children's diets and reduced stunting among younger siblings of targeted
      preschoolers. This trial was registered on the ISRCTN registry as
      ISCRCTN96497560.

TI  - An agriculture-nutrition intervention improved children's diet and growth in a
      randomized trial in Ghana.
PG  - e12677

AB  - Stunting in Ghana is associated with rural communities, poverty, and low
      education; integrated agricultural interventions can address the problem. This
      cluster randomized controlled trial tested the effect of a 12-month intervention 
      (inputs and training for poultry farming and home gardening, and nutrition and
      health education) on child diet and nutritional status. Sixteen clusters were
      identified and randomly assigned to intervention or control; communities within
      clusters were randomly chosen, and all interested, eligible mother-child pairs
      were enrolled (intervention: 8 clusters, 19 communities, and 287 households;
      control: 8 clusters, 20 communities, and 213 households). Intention-to-treat
      analyses were used to estimate the effect of the intervention on endline minimum 
      diet diversity (>/=4 food groups), consumption of eggs, and length-for-age
      (LAZ)/height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length
      (WLZ)/weight-for-height (WHZ) z-scores; standard errors were corrected for
      clustering. Children were 10.5 +/- 5.2 months (range: 0-32) at baseline and 29.8 
      +/- 5.4 months (range: 13-48) at endline. Compared with children in the control
      group, children in the intervention group met minimum diet diversity (adjusted
      odds ratio = 1.65, 95% CI [1.02, 2.69]) and a higher LAZ/HAZ (beta = 0.22, 95% CI
      [0.09, 0.34]) and WAZ (beta = 0.15, 95% CI [0.00, 0.30]). Sensitivity analyses
      with random-effects and mixed-effects models and as-treated analysis were
      consistent with the findings. There was no group difference in WLZ/WHZ.
      Integrated interventions that increase access to high-quality foods and nutrition
      education improve child nutrition.

AB  - The Chinese highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
      (HP-PRRSV) has caused a severe threat to the pig population in Southeast Asian
      countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a type 2 
      PRRSV modified live vaccine (PrimePac PRRS, lineage 7) against a Thai HP-PRRSV
      (10PL01, lineage 8). Three-week-old PRRSV-free pigs were randomly assigned into
      three groups. Vaccinated challenged group (group 1, n = 16) was immunized with
      PrimePac PRRS vaccine at 3 weeks old. The unvaccinated challenged group (group 2,
      n = 16) was injected with PBS at 3 weeks old, and unvaccinated unchallenged group
      (group 3, n = 10) was served as a negative control. At 9 weeks old, all groups,
      except the negative control group, were challenged with the Thai HP-PRRSV. All
      pigs were monitored daily during 10 days post-infection (dpi) and were necropsied
      at 10 and 17 dpi. The results revealed that vaccinated challenged pigs showed
      significantly lower (p < 0.05) mean rectal temperatures, clinical respiratory
      scores, lung lesion scores, and levels of virus load in serum and lung tissue
      compared with the unvaccinated challenged pigs. Moreover, vaccinated challenged
      pigs exhibited PRRSV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies at the end of the
      experiment. Our findings indicated that the studied type 2 PRRSV vaccine provided
      partial protection against the Thai HP-PRRSV infection based on the body
      temperature, levels of viremia, and the severity of lung lesions. These results
      demonstrated that partial protection of PrimePac PRRS vaccine might be useful for
      controlling HP-PRRSV infection in the endemic area.

TI  - 'Yellow is good for you': Consumer perception and acceptability of fortified and 
      biofortified cassava products.
PG  - e0203421
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0203421 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin A, an essential micronutrient for health, can be obtained from various
      food sources including cassava products made from either traditional white
      cassava varieties fortified with red palm oil containing provitamin A, or new
      high provitamin A biofortified yellow cassava varieties. Both products have a
      similar yellow appearance due to the coloured pigmentation of provitamin A. Using
      a range of methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of sensory
      acceptability (blind triangle test, sensory profiling, hedonic preference that
      included Check-all-that-applies and Just-about-right tests), we tested the
      acceptability and nutritional perception of traditional West-African food
      dough-like products (eba and fufu) made from biofortified, fortified, or control 
      products made with non-fortified white cassava (n = 7) at three suburban
      locations near Ibadan, Nigeria on a total of 122 consumers. Biofortified,
      fortified, and control products could be differentiated blindly confirming that
      products clearly differed with respect to other sensory characteristics than
      appearance. Overall biofortified products were better accepted than control and
      fortified ones. Three classes of consumer preference were identified based on the
      dislike for control and fortified products, which indicated that acceptance of
      biofortified products was not a hindrance. On the contrary the traditional
      fortified product had poorer acceptance and this was due to its less desirable
      sensory characteristics as demonstrated by Just-about-right Penalty analysis. A
      majority of consumers (85%) had previous knowledge of biofortified cassava.
      Consumers associated 'yellow colour' with 'good for eyesight', 'good for
      children's health' and 'new'. More nutritional benefits were attributed to
      biofortified than fortified products although they had similar provitamin A
      contents and this demonstrates a bias. We suggest that nutrition promotion
      campaigns to improve the vitamin A status should also encompass all natural
      sources of provitamin A, including biofortified and traditional fortified
      products.

AB  - Pain sensitivity and skull/brain injury associated with cautery, cryosurgical and
      caustic paste disbudding were evaluated in goat kids. Kids (reared for meat;
      n=280) were randomly assigned to one of four treatments (n=70 per treatment): (1)
      sham-handling (SHAM) or (2) cautery (CAUT), (3) cryosurgical (CRYO) or (4)
      caustic paste (CASP) disbudding. A pain sensitivity test was carried out 15min
      pre-treatment and 1h post-treatment. Skull/brain injury was assessed at
      post-mortem examination. Kids with evidence of injury to the skull/brain, as well
      as a random sample of kids (n=15 per treatment) without evidence of skull/brain
      injury, were selected for histological examination of brain tissue. Average daily
      gains (ADG) were calculated from body weight measurements taken 10min
      pre-treatment and then at 2, 7 and 14days post-treatment as a measure of the
      potential effects of pain or injury on growth. CASP and CRYO kids displayed
      higher pain sensitivity post-treatment than CAUT or SHAM kids, suggesting that
      they experienced more acute pain 1h post-treatment. One of 70 CAUT kids had a
      perforated skull, but there was no histological evidence of brain injury in this 
      animal; a further nine CAUT kids exhibited hyperaemia of the skull. The other
      treatments did not result in injury to the skull/brain. There was no evidence of 
      a difference in ADG across treatments. Caustic paste and cryosurgical disbudding 
      resulted in greater acute pain sensitivity than cautery disbudding; however,
      cautery disbudding has the potential to cause skull injury if performed
      incorrectly.

TI  - A home-based mentored vegetable gardening intervention demonstrates feasibility
      and improvements in physical activity and performance among breast cancer
      survivors.
PG  - 3427-3435
LID - 10.1002/cncr.31559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study assessed the feasibility of a mentored home-based
      vegetable gardening intervention and examined changes in health-related outcomes 
      among breast cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: BCS were randomized to either a
      year-long vegetable gardening intervention to begin immediately or a wait-list
      control. Master Gardeners mentored participants in planning, planting, and
      maintaining 3 seasonal gardens over the course of 1 year. Participant accrual,
      retention, and satisfaction rates of >/=80% served as feasibility (primary
      outcome) benchmarks. Secondary outcomes (ie, vegetable consumption, physical
      activity, performance and function, anthropometrics, biomarkers, and
      health-related quality of life) were collected at baseline and post-intervention 
      (1-year follow-up) using subjective and objective measures. RESULTS: The trial
      surpassed all feasibility benchmarks at 82% of targeted accrual, 95% retention,
      and 100% satisfaction (ie, experience ratings of "good to excellent" and
      willingness to "do it again"). Compared with the controls, intervention
      participants reported significantly greater improvements in moderate physical
      activity (+14 vs -17 minutes/week) and demonstrated improvements in the 2-Minute 
      Step Test (+22 vs + 10 steps), and Arm Curl (+2.7 vs + 0.1 repetitions) (P values
      < .05). A trend toward improved vegetable consumption was observed (+0.9 vs + 0.2
      servings/day; P = .06). Approximately 86% of participants were continuing to
      garden at the 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study
      suggest that a mentored, home-based vegetable gardening intervention is feasible 
      and offers an integrative and durable approach with which to improve health
      behaviors and outcomes among BCS. Harvest for Health led to the establishment of 
      a group of trained Master Gardeners and gave rise to local and global
      community-based programs. Larger studies are needed to confirm the results
      presented herein and to define applicability across broader populations of
      survivors.

TI  - Effects of iron supplementation and nutrition education on haemoglobin, ferritin 
      and oxidative stress in iron-deficient female adolescents in Palestine:
      randomized control trial.
PG  - 560-568
LID - 10.26719/2018.24.6.560 [doi]
AB  - Background: Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia are associated with
      oxidative stress, but their role is largely unclear. Information is scarce on the
      effects of iron supplementation on biomarkers of oxidative stress in humans.
      Aims: This study evaluated the effectiveness of iron supplementation and
      nutrition education on improving the levels of haemoglobin and ferritin, and
      decreasing oxidative stress among iron-deficient female adolescents in Gaza,
      Palestine. Methods: A total 131 iron-deficient female adolescents were recruited 
      and allocated randomly into 3 different groups. The iron supplementation group
      (A) received 200 mg of ferrous fumarate weekly during the 3-month intervention,
      the iron supplementation with nutrition education group (B) received iron
      supplements with nutrition education sessions, and the control group (C) did not 
      receive any intervention. The levels of haemoglobin, ferritin and malonyl
      dialdehyde were measured at baseline, after 3 months (at which point the
      intervention was stopped), and then 3 months later. Trial registration number:
      ACTRN12618000960257. Results: Haemoglobin levels increased significantly after
      supplementation in both groups A and B. At the follow-up stage (3 months after
      stopping the intervention), iron and haemoglobin levels in group B continued to
      increase and malonyl dialdehyde decreased. In Group A, haemoglobin, ferritin and 
      malonyl dialdehyde levels decreased after 3 months of stopping the intervention. 
      No changes were seen in Group C. Conclusions: A nutrition programme should be
      adopted and integrated into comprehensive intervention programmes to target
      iron-deficiency anaemia among female adolescents in Palestine.

TI  - Testing the Feasibility and Preliminary Efficacy of an 8-Week Exercise and
      Compensatory Eating Intervention.
LID - E923 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu10070923 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
      an intervention comprised of regular exercise alongside educational and
      motivational support for participants' avoidance of unhealthy compensatory
      eating. Forty-five sedentary individuals were randomized to an 8-week exercise
      plus compensatory eating avoidance program (CEAP; n = 24), or an 8-week exercise 
      intervention only (control; n = 21). The feasibility and preliminary efficacy of 
      the intervention were assessed using quantitative measures and supplemented with 
      written responses to open-ended questions. The CEAP workshop was well-received;
      however, self-reported use of some of the included behavior change strategies was
      lower than expected. Post-intervention, there was evidence of reduced
      self-reported compensatory eating for participants in the CEAP group but not
      controls, with CEAP participants also reporting greater use of coping plans
      relative to controls post-intervention. The exercise program had benefits for
      waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, and cardiovascular
      fitness; however, improvements were similar between groups. Taken together, the
      results of this study indicate that the CEAP is feasible and may reduce
      compensatory eating around exercise; however, this effect is small. Potential
      modifications to the CEAP are discussed within the paper.

TI  - Impact of a Pilot School-Based Nutrition Intervention on Dietary Knowledge,
      Attitudes, Behavior and Nutritional Status of Syrian Refugee Children in the
      Bekaa, Lebanon.
LID - E913 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu10070913 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated the impact of a 6-month school nutrition intervention on
      changes in dietary knowledge, attitude, behavior (KAB) and nutritional status of 
      Syrian refugee children. A quasi-experimental design was followed; Syrian refuge 
      children in grades 4 to 6 were recruited from three informal primary schools (two
      intervention and one control) located in the rural Bekaa region of Lebanon. The
      intervention consisted of two main components: classroom-based education sessions
      and provision of locally-prepared healthy snacks. Data on household
      socio-demographic characteristics, KAB, anthropometric measures and dietary
      intake of children were collected by trained field workers at baseline and
      post-intervention. Of the 296 school children enrolled, 203 (68.6%) completed
      post-intervention measures. Significant increases in dietary knowledge (beta =
      1.22, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.89), attitude (beta = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.08, 1.30), and body
      mass index-for-age-z-scores (beta = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.10, 0.41) were observed
      among intervention vs. control groups, adjusting for covariates (p < 0.05).
      Compared to the control, the intervention group had, on average, significantly
      larger increases in daily intakes of total energy, dietary fiber, protein,
      saturated fat, and several key micronutrients, p < 0.05. Findings suggest a
      positive impact of this school-based nutrition intervention on dietary knowledge,
      attitude, and nutritional status of Syrian refugee children. Further studies are 
      needed to test the feasibility and long-term impact of scaling-up such
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress-related illnesses are a major threat to public health, and
      there is increasing demand for validated treatments.AimsTo test the efficacy of
      nature-based therapy (NBT) for patients with stress-related illnesses. METHOD:
      Randomised controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01849718) comparing
      Nacadia(R) NBT (NNBT) with the cognitive-behavioural therapy known as Specialised
      Treatment for Severe Bodily Distress Syndromes (STreSS). In total, 84
      participants were randomly allocated to one of the two treatments. The primary
      outcome measure was the mean aggregate score on the Psychological General
      Well-Being Index (PGWBI). RESULTS: Both treatments resulted in a significant
      increase in the PGWBI (primary outcome) and a decrease in burnout (the
      Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire, secondary outcome), which were both
      sustained 12 months later. No significant difference in efficacy was found
      between NNBT and STreSS for primary outcome and secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study showed no statistical evidence of a difference between NNBT and STreSS 
      for treating patients with stress-related illnesses.Declaration of interestNone.

TI  - Impact of a trap-neuter-return event on the size of free-roaming cat colonies
      around barns and stables in Quebec: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 192-197
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a trap-neuter-return
      (TNR) event on the size of free-roaming rural cat colonies in Quebec. This
      prospective randomized, controlled study included 18 cat colonies around barns
      and stables that were randomly assigned to either a TNR group (10 colonies of 7
      to 27 cats; 14.3 cats on average) or a control group (8 colonies of 7 to 26 cats;
      14.5 cats on average). The number of cats in each colony was calculated from the 
      images obtained by camera-trapping at: baseline (T0), 7.5 mo (T7), and 12 mo
      (T12). At baseline, the TNR group was subjected to a TNR event. When taking into 
      account adults only, a significant growth difference was observed in the number
      of cats between the TNR group and the control group at T7 (P = 0.03). When
      including kittens as well as adults, a trend towards a lower growth of the TNR
      group compared to the control group was noted at T7 (P = 0.06). There was no
      difference in the number of kittens between the 2 groups at T7 (P = 0.49) or at
      T12 (P = 0.36). There was a trend towards more emigration in the control group at
      T12 (P = 0.095). Isolated TNR events have a low and temporary impact on colony
      size in Quebec's rural cat colonies.

TI  - Effect of nutrition education and psychosocial factors on child feeding
      practices: findings of a field experiment with biofortified foods and different
      women categories.
PG  - 346-371
LID - 10.1080/03670244.2018.1492382 [doi]
AB  - Despite the efforts to promote good practices in infant and young child feeding
      (IYCF), the adoption of such practices has been low. Using data from a sample of 
      665 women, and the theory of planned behavior, we examine the effect of different
      types of nutrition education and psychosocial factors on the use of recommended
      IYCF practices. Regression results show that nutrition education and psychosocial
      factors have strong positive effect on the extent to which IYCF practices are
      used, with the latter having conflicting individual but overall positive effect. 
      Moreover, coefficients of latter were mostly less than those of the former
      indicating that pschosocial factors were less important in explaining variability
      in usage of IYCF than the nutrition education variables. It further finds that
      different sets of nutrition education and psychosocial factors affect different
      categories of women, with interactive nutrition education approaches having a
      greater effect. The findings also suggest need for targeting of beneficiaries
      with multiple nutrition education approaches.

TI  - Effect of enhanced homestead food production and aquaculture on dietary intakes
      of women and children in rural Cambodia: A cluster randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e12581
LID - 10.1111/mcn.12581 [doi]
AB  - The Cambodian diet is low in nutrient-dense animal-source foods. Enhanced
      homestead food production (EHFP) and aquaculture, which increase availability of 
      nutrient-dense foods, are promising interventions to improve dietary intake. This
      study examined the effect of EHFP with or without aquaculture on dietary intake
      and prevalence of inadequate intake of select nutrients among women and children 
      living in rural Cambodia, compared to controls. In a registered, cluster
      randomized controlled trial in Prey Veng, Cambodia, 10 households in each of 90
      villages (n = 900) were randomized by village to receive EHFP, EHFP plus
      aquaculture, or control. After 22-month intervention, 24-hr dietary recalls
      (24HRs) were collected from mothers aged 18-50 years (n = 429) and their children
      aged 6 months-7 years (n = 421), reported by their mothers. Usual intake
      distributions (generated using 24HRs and repeat 24HRs on a subsample) were used
      to estimate prevalence of inadequate intake. Compared to controls, women in the
      EHFP group had significantly higher zinc (+1.0 mg/d) and Vitamin A (+139 retinol 
      activity equivalents/d) intakes, and women in the EHFP plus aquaculture group had
      significantly higher iron (+2.7 mg/d), Vitamin A (+191 retinol activity
      equivalents/d), and riboflavin (+0.17 mg/d) intakes. Women in the EHFP plus
      aquaculture group also had significantly lower prevalence of inadequate iron
      (-7%, at 10% bioavailability), Vitamin A (-19%), and riboflavin (-17%) intakes,
      compared to controls. No significant differences in intakes or nutrient adequacy 
      were observed among children or between EHFP and EHFP plus aquaculture groups.
      The biological importance of the small differences in nutrient intakes among
      women remains to be established.

AB  - This group-randomized controlled trial examines the effects of a school garden
      intervention on availability of fruits and vegetables (FV) in elementary school
      children's homes. Within each region, low income U.S. schools in Arkansas, Iowa, 
      New York, and Washington State were randomly assigned to intervention group
      (n=24) or waitlist control group (n=22). Children were in grades 2, 4, and 5 at
      baseline (n=2768). The garden intervention consisted of both raised-bed garden
      kits and a series of grade-appropriate lessons. FV availability at home was
      measured with a modified version of the GEMS FJV Availability Questionnaire. The 
      instrument was administered at baseline (Fall 2011) and throughout the
      intervention (Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013). Analyses were completed using
      general linear mixed models. The garden intervention led to an overall increase
      in availability of low-fat vegetables at home. Among younger children (2nd grade 
      at baseline), the garden intervention led to greater home availability of
      vegetables, especially, low-fat vegetables. Moreover, for the younger group,
      garden intervention fidelity (GIF) or robustness predicted home availability of
      fruit, vegetables, and low-fat vegetables. School gardens have potential to
      affect FV availability in the home environment.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to assess a hormonal strategy developed to reduce 
      animal handling for timed artificial insemination (TAI) with sex-sorted semen.
      Four-hundred ninety-one (491) suckled beef cows received a progesterone (P4)
      intravaginal device and 2mg intramuscular (im) injection of estradiol benzoate
      (EB) on a randomly chosen day of the estrus cycle (Day 0) in Experiment 1. Cows
      were treated with 500mug of sodic cloprostenol (PGF2alpha) and with 300 IU of eCG
      at P4 device removal (Day 8); these cows were also randomly assigned to receive
      1mg of estradiol cypionate (EC) administered at P4 device removal (treatment
      EC-0h) or 1mg of EB 24h after P4 device removal (treatment EB-24h). Both
      treatments were timed inseminated (TAI) with sex-sorted semen 60h after P4 device
      removal. Cows treated with EC-0h presented higher pregnancy rate per AI (P/AI)
      [45.0% (113/251)] than the ones treated with EB-24h [35.4% (85/240); P=0.03)]. A 
      subset of cows (n=26) were subjected to ultrasound examination every 12h after P4
      device removal for 96h in the row in order to determine the time of ovulation.
      Similar interval between device removal and ovulation was recorded for
      EB-24h=70.0+/-2.9h vs. EC-0h=66.0+/-2.8h(P=0.52). Five-hundred ninety-one (591)
      cows were subjected to the same synchronization protocols and treatments (EC-0h
      or EB-24h). In addition, they were randomly assigned to a 2x2 factorial
      arrangement aiming at determining the effects of treatment with estradiol (EC-0h 
      vs. EB-24h) and of semen type (Sex-sorted vs. Non-sex-sorted semen). All animals 
      were timed inseminated 60h after P4 device removal. There was no interaction
      (P=0.07) between the ovulation inducer and semen type. The EC protocol led to
      greater P/AI than EB (P=0.03). Greater (P=0.01) P/AI was achieved through
      treatments with non-sex-sorted semen rather than with sex-sorted semen
      [sex-sorted (EB-24h=49.0%; EC-0h=51.0%) vs. non-sex-sorted semen (EB-24h=52.4%;
      EC-0h=68.2%)]. Therefore, EC administered at P4 device removal resulted in
      greater P/AI. Furthermore, the EC-0h protocol allowed reducing suckled beef cow
      handing for timed artificial insemination with sex-sorted semen.

AB  - Background: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the first cause of death
      worldwide. Mediterranean diet may play a crucial role in the prevention of NCDs, 
      and the presence of wine in this diet could play a positive role on health.
      Methods: 54 healthy volunteers consumed one of the following beverages: red (RW) 
      or white wine (WW), vodka (VDK), and/or Mediterranean meal (MeDM) and high-fat
      meal (HFM). Results: OxLDL-C changed significantly between baseline versus HFM,
      MeDM versus HFM, and HFM versus HFM + RW (p < 0.05). Significant upregulation of 
      catalase (CAT) was observed only after RW. Conversely, WW, VDK, RW + MeDM, HF +
      WW, and HF + VDK determined a significant downregulation of CAT gene. Superoxide 
      dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene expression was upregulated in WW, MeDM + VDK, and RW.
      Contrariwise, HFM + VDK determined a downregulation of its expression. RW, RW +
      MeDM, and RW + HFM caused the upregulation of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1).
      Conclusions: Our results suggest that the association of low/moderate intake of
      alcohol beverages, with nutraceutical-proven effectiveness, and ethanol, in
      association with a Mediterranean diet, could determine a reduction of
      atherosclerosis risk onset through a positive modulation of antioxidant gene
      expression helping in the prevention of inflammatory and oxidative damages.

TI  - Amyloodiniosis in cultured Dicentrarchus labrax: parasitological and molecular
      diagnosis, and an improved treatment protocol.
PG  - 41-51
LID - 10.3354/dao03237 [doi]
AB  - Amyloodinium ocellatum, the causative agent of amyloodiniosis (marine velvet,
      velvet disease), affects marine and brackish fish in various warm and temperate
      habitats. We recorded disease outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality rates
      in marine-cultured European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax fry at 2 locations in
      northwest Egypt. The sudden outbreak, high morbidity and mortality rates, and
      skin lesions with a velvety appearance in affected fish all indicated A.
      ocellatum infection. This was further confirmed by microscopic findings of the
      parasitic stage (trophonts) in skin and gill smears. While ecological factors
      including water temperature and salinity were all amenable to parasite
      establishment and propagation, mortality rates differed between the 2 farms, with
      rates of mortality well correlated with prevalence and intensity of A. ocellatum 
      infections. Characterization by PCR targeting rDNA gene fragments and subsequent 
      DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis further confirmed the molecular identity
      of the A. ocellatum isolate, which was genetically similar to isolates from other
      geographical locations. Finally, an improved treatment method using dual
      hyposalination and copper sulfate exposure to increase the efficiency and
      decrease the toxicity of copper sulfate was tested. The gradual reduction in
      water salinity coupled with copper sulfate treatment was more efficient at
      controlling the disease than only applying copper sulfate. To our knowledge, this
      is the first parasitological and molecular characterization of A. ocellatum in
      marine cultures in Egypt. The high molecular identity and close phylogenetic
      relationship further confirmed the monophyletic nature of A. ocellatum isolates.

TI  - Milk fatty acid profile from cows fed with mixed rations and different access
      time to pastureland during early lactation.
PG  - 620-629
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12826 [doi]
AB  - Milk fatty acid (FA) profiles were determined in Holstein cows (n = 27) fed total
      mixed rations (TMR) ad libitum (G0) or diet composed by TMR (50% dry matter [DM] 
      offered) plus grazing of pasture with 6 hr of access time to paddock in one
      session (G1) or 9 hr in two sessions (G2) at 45 days in milk (DIM). Moreover,
      milk FA was determined at 65 DIM when G0 cows turned out to G1 diet without
      adaptation period (Post-G0), G1 remained as controls. Milk FA was quantified
      using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Preformed FA at 45 DIM was
      greater (+27%) for G2 than G0 cows (p < .05). Stearic acid (C18:0) was 30%
      greater for G2 cows (p < .05). De novo FA was lowest for G2 cows (p < .05).
      Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) did not differ (p < .12), while vaccenic acid
      (C18:1trans) was twofold greater for grazing treatments (p < .01). Linolenic acid
      [C18:3(n-3)] was greatest for G2 and lowest for G0 cows (p < .01). Omega 6 FA was
      greater for G0 than grazing cows, mainly due to linoleic acid [18:2cis(n-6); p < 
      .05]. These results determined that n-6/n-3 ratio was almost threefold greater
      for G0 than grazing cows (p < .001). When diet of G0 cows changed to include
      pasture (Post-G0), preformed FA increased (p < .05), explained mainly by the
      increase (p < .05) of stearic (C18:0) and C18:1trans, while de novo FA tended to 
      decrease (p < .1). Moreover, the amount of CLA and C18:3(n-3) tended to increase 
      (p < .1) in Post-G0 cows. Offering 50% of dietary DM from pasture modified milk
      FA profile in early lactation potentially beneficial for human health. When
      TMR-fed cows were turned out to 50% pasture, milk FA profile reflected dietary
      change without need of an adaptation period.

TI  - VITAL change for mums: a feasibility study investigating tailored nutrition and
      exercise care delivered by video-consultations for women 3-12 months postpartum.
PG  - 337-348
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A tailored approach to nutrition and physical activity advice can
      support women following childbirth in managing barriers (i.e. time and childcare)
      to making healthy lifestyle changes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
      the implementation, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a personally
      tailored nutrition and exercise programme for postpartum women delivered via
      video-consultations by an accredited practising dietitian (APD) and accredited
      exercise physiologist (AEP). METHODS: In this feasibility study (VITAL change for
      mums), postpartum (3-12 months) women (body mass index >/=25 or >2 kg above
      pre-pregnancy weight) who were seeking to achieve a healthy weight participated
      in a single-arm intervention. Participants received up to five real-time
      personalised video-consultations (2 x APD, 2 x AEP, 1 x either) over the 8-week
      intervention period. Implementation (recruitment, retention, utilisation),
      acceptability (participant satisfaction) and preliminary efficacy (anthropometry,
      dietary intake, cardiovascular fitness, physical activity level, psychological
      wellbeing) were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty women [mean (SD) age 31.6 (3.1) years, 
      body mass index 29.0 (4.0) kg m(-2) , 100% married/de facto, 80% university level
      education] were recruited within 10 days and 27 completed the study. Women's mean
      (SD) ratings (out of a score of 5) indicated satisfaction with the
      video-consultations [4.4 (0.9)] and the online setting [4.5 (0.8)]. Women agreed 
      that accessing an APD [4.4 (0.8)] and AEP [4.3 (0.9)] was easier using
      video-consultations than attending an in-person consultation. Statistically
      significant improvements in waist circumference, body composition,
      cardiorespiratory fitness, dietary intake and physical activity were observed
      from baseline to 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest 
      that a nutrition and exercise intervention delivered by qualified health
      professionals via video-consultations is feasible, acceptable and achieves
      positive outcomes for women following childbirth.

AB  - The objective of this field study was to evaluate the reproductive performance of
      sows after vaccination with a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
      (PRRS) subunit vaccine (PRRSFREE PRRS subunit vaccine, Reber Genetics, Taiwan,
      Republic of China) under field conditions. The study was performed in three farms
      with endemic infections with both PRRS virus (PRRSV)-1 and PRRSV-2, a situation
      representative of most Korean farms. Pregnant sows were immunised intramuscularly
      with 2.0 ml of the PRRS subunit vaccine at 58 and 79 days of gestation (eight and
      five weeks antepartum) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.
      Vaccination did not result in any observed adverse reaction. Vaccinated sows
      exhibited a significant improvement in reproductive performance (reduction of
      abortions) and litter characteristics (increase of weaned pigs) compared with
      unvaccinated sows. Vaccinated sows had significantly (P<0.05) higher PRRSV ELISA 
      sample/positive ratio and number of PRRSV-specific interferon-gamma-secreting
      cells compared with the unvaccinated control group. The results of this study
      demonstrate that the PRRS subunit vaccine can improve the reproductive
      performance of sows in farms with endemic PRRSV infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Engaging in health-promoting behaviors (e.g., healthy fruit- and
      vegetable-rich diet, physical activity) and living in supportive social and built
      environments are consistently and significantly associated with reductions in
      cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. Interventions to
      change diet and physical activity behaviors should aim to educate individuals,
      change the environments in which people live, work and recreate, improve access, 
      availability, and affordability of healthy foods, and create safe places the
      facilitate active lifestyles. This trial will assess whether community gardening 
      increases fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity, improves social 
      support and mental health, and reduces age-associated weight gain and sedentary
      time among a multi-ethnic, mixed-income population. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized 
      controlled trial of community gardening began in Denver, Colorado in January
      2017. Over 3years, we will recruit 312 consenting participants on Denver Urban
      Gardens' waitlists and randomize them to garden or remain on the waitlist. At
      baseline (pre-gardening), harvest time, and post-intervention, study participants
      will complete three 24-hour dietary recalls, a 7-day activity monitoring period
      using accelerometry, a health interview and physical anthropometry. DISCUSSION:
      This project addresses health-promoting behaviors among a multi-ethnic,
      mixed-income adult population in a large metropolitan area. If successful, this
      trial will provide evidence that community gardening supports and sustains
      healthy and active lifestyles, which can reduce risk of cancer and other chronic 
      diseases. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03089177: Registered on

TI  - A randomized controlled trial on the effect of incomplete milking during the

      dairy cows.

AB  - An incomplete milking in early lactation could help limit negative energy balance
      in dairy cattle, but its potential effects on culling hazard and on milk
      production and composition throughout the entire lactation are unknown. The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an incomplete milking
      during the first 5 d in milk on culling hazard, milk weight, milk fat and protein
      concentrations, and energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield during the whole lactation.
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 13 dairy farms near St-Hyacinthe, 
      Quebec, Canada. Approximately 1 mo before expected calving, Holstein multiparous 
      cows calving between December 2013 and March 2015 (n = 846 cow lactations) were
      randomly assigned to a control or a treatment group. Cows in the control group
      were milked conventionally, whereas cows in the treatment group were submitted to
      an incomplete milking protocol (maximum of 10, 12, and 14 L/d of milk was
      collected on days in milk 1-3, 4, and 5, respectively). All farms were registered
      on Dairy Herd Improvement Association, which was used to obtain records on
      culling, monthly milk yield, and milk fat and protein concentrations. In
      addition, daily milk yield records were available for 6 farms. A Cox proportional
      hazards model with a herd frailty term was fitted to the data to compare culling 
      hazard among treatment groups. Regarding milk production and composition, 4
      linear mixed models with herd as a fixed effect, cow as a random effect, and
      using an autoregressive covariance structure were used to study the effect of the
      incomplete milking on (1) milk weight, (2) milk fat concentration, (3) milk
      protein concentration, and (4) ECM yield. Culling hazard did not differ among
      treatment groups (hazard ratio = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.82, 1.3). We observed no
      differences in milk weight, milk fat, or protein concentration among treatment
      groups between weeks in milk (WIM) 2 and 44 (the studied period). We noted a
      difference in ECM between treatment groups for WIM 38, with incompletely milked
      cows producing less milk than conventionally milked cows (-2.7 kg/d; 95% CI =
      -0.02, -5.2 kg/d), but no differences were found for any of the other WIM. These 
      results suggest that this strategy for controlling the negative energy balance
      has negligible effect on cow productivity.

AB  - Limiting milk production for a short period of time in early lactation could be a
      relevant strategy to prevent hyperketonemia (HYK). From December 2013 to March
      2015, 838 multiparous Holstein cows from 13 herds were enrolled in a randomized
      controlled trial evaluating the effect of incomplete milking in early lactation
      on ketonemia and its effect on body condition score (BCS) loss. Cows were
      randomly assigned 4 wk before expected calving date to 1 of 2 treatment groups,
      (1) a conventional milking protocol (CON) for which cows were completely milked
      or (2) an incomplete milking protocol (INC) for which a maximum of 10 to 14 kg of
      milk/d were withdrawn during the first 5 d in milk (DIM). beta-Hydroxybutyrate
      (BHB) concentrations were measured from blood samples collected on each cow 3
      times at weekly intervals. Hyperketonemia was defined as BHB >/=1.4 mmol/L. Body 
      condition score variation in the postcalving period was calculated by subtracting
      BCS assessed at wk 7 from BCS assessed at first week after calving. Effect of
      treatment on ketonemia and prevalence of HYK were evaluated for 4 specific time
      periods: 1 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 17, and 18 to 26 DIM. Effect of treatment on
      ketonemia was investigated using linear mixed models with natural logarithm of
      BHB measurements as outcome and treatment groups as fixed effect. Generalized
      linear mixed models with HYK as outcome, using logit link, and treatment groups
      as fixed effect were used to investigate effect of treatment on odds of HYK. A
      logistic regression model with BCS loss (<0.75 or >/=0.75) as outcome and
      treatment groups and herd as fixed effects was used to study effect of INC on
      odds of having BCS loss >/=0.75. A total of 813 lactations had complete data and 
      were used for statistical analysis of ketonemia and HYK. A total of 709
      lactations had complete data and were used for analysis of BCS loss. Geometric
      means of blood BHB concentrations during the 1 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 17, and 18 to
      26 DIM periods were, respectively, 0.72 (95% confidence interval = 0.66, 0.80),
      0.66 (0.60, 0.73), 0.90 (0.80, 1.01), and 0.93 (0.83, 1.05) mmol/L for INC, and
      0.65 (0.59, 0.72), 0.79 (0.72, 0.87), 0.94 (0.84, 1.06), and 0.92 (0.82, 1.04)
      mmol/L for CON. Cows in INC group had lower ketonemia during the 4 to 7 DIM
      period. Predicted prevalence of HYK during the 1 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 17, and 18 to
      26 DIM periods were, respectively, 2.8 (3.2, 15.1), 4.6 (2.0, 10.0), 13.4 (8.4,
      20.0), and 23.0% (17.4, 29.7) for INC and 2.6 (2.5, 13.8), 10.7 (5.6, 19.3), 19.4
      (13.0, 27.9), and 21.3% (16.0, 27.8) for CON. The INC treatment reduced the
      prevalence of HYK during the 4 to 7 and 8 to 17 DIM periods. No association was
      observed between INC and BCS loss in the postcalving period. Overall, the
      incomplete milking protocol was effective for reducing ketonemia and prevalence
      of HYK during the early postpartum period.

TI  - Effect of ionization, bedding, and feeding on air quality in a horse stable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Organic dust is associated with Equine asthma. Ionization should
      reduce airborne dust levels. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of ionization of
      air, type of bedding, and feed on the levels of airborne dust, endotoxin, and
      fungal colonies in horse stables. ANIMALS: 24 healthy University-owned horses
      occupied the stables. METHODS: A randomized controlled cross-over study. Four
      units with 6 stables were equipped with an ionization installation (25 VA, 5000
      Volt Direct Current). Horses were kept either on wood shavings and fed haylage (2
      units), or on straw and fed dry hay (2 units). Measurements were performed with
      and without activated ionization, during daytime and nighttime, repeatedly over
      the course of a week and repeatedly during 4-6 weeks. Statistical analysis was
      performed using a mixed effect model with Akaike's Information Criterion for
      model reduction and 95% profile (log) likelihood confidence intervals (CI).
      RESULTS: Ionization did not alter concentrations of dust, endotoxin, or fungi,
      fewer. In the units with straw and hay, the concentration of dust, endotoxin, and
      fungi (difference in logarithmic mean 1.92 (95%CI 1.71-2.12); 2.86 (95%CI
      2.59-3.14); 1.75 (95%CI 1.13-2.36)) were significantly higher compared to wood
      shavings and haylage. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The installation of a 
      negative air-ionizer in the horse stable did not reduce concentrations of dust,
      endotoxin, and viable fungal spores. The substantial effect of low dust bedding
      and feed is confirmed.

TI  - Mediterranean Diet, Glucose Homeostasis, and Inflammasome Genetic Variants: The
      CORDIOPREV Study.
PG  - e1700960
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201700960 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Insulin resistance (IR) and chronic low-grade inflammation are hallmarks
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The "NOD-like receptor pyrin domain
      containing-3" (NLRP3) inflammasome component of innate immunity is a metabolic
      stress sensor modulated by dietary and genetics factors. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the effects of the consumption of two diets for 3 years,
      Mediterranean (Med) and low fat, on glucose homeostasis in the 1002 coronary
      heart disease patients of the CORDIOPREV study, according to a genetic variant of
      NLRP3 inflammasome. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted in the framework
      of the CORDIOPREV study, a randomized dietary intervention with Med and low-fat
      diets. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at inflammasome NLRP3 gene 
      were genotyped by OpenArray platform. Nondiabetic CT+TT carriers of the rs4612666
      SNP and AG+AA carriers of the rs10733113 SNP increased insulin sensitivity index 
      (ISI) after 3 years of dietary intervention, whereas no effect was observed in
      diabetic patients. Further analysis by diet showed that the improvement of the
      ISI in nondiabetic rs10733113 AG+AA carriers was specific to the consumption of
      the Med diet. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the benefits associated with a
      Med diet regarding glucose homeostasis in non-T2DM patients depend on genetic
      variation in the inflammasome.

TI  - A clear trade-off exists between the theoretical efficiency and acceptability of 
      dietary changes that improve nutrient adequacy during early pregnancy in French
      women: Combined data from simulated changes modeling and online assessment
      survey.
PG  - e0194764
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0194764 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, the diet of a mother-to-be should be adapted to
      meet increases in nutrient requirements. We analyzed the theoretical efficiency
      and acceptability of different types of tailored dietary changes for pregnant
      women. METHODS: The nutrient adequacy of the diet was evaluated using the PANDiet
      score, by comparing the nutrient intakes of 344 non-pregnant premenopausal women 
      (18-44y) with dietary reference intakes for the first trimester of pregnancy.
      Simulations were performed to evaluate the theoretical efficiency of three types 
      of ten successive tailored dietary changes in improving nutrient adequacy, with
      graded difficulty in implementation. The acceptability (declared intention to use
      in the diet) of most efficient dietary changes was evaluated during an online
      randomized study including 115 French pregnant women (22-41y). RESULTS: Modifying
      the amount consumed of foods (type-1) did not modify the food repertoire and
      resulted in the smallest theoretical efficiency (increase in the PANDiet score of
      9.8+/-0.2 points), but changes were the most acceptable (probability of the
      intention to use: 0.30-0.78). Conversely, replacing food items by items from the 
      same group or eaten at the same time (type-3) broadened the food repertoire
      (3.6+/-1.3 food subgroups added) and resulted in the greatest theoretical
      efficiency (+23.9+/-0.3) but changes were the least acceptable (0.07-0.23).
      Replacing food items within the same subgroup (type-2) slightly broadened the
      food repertoire (+8.0+/-1.3 foods) and resulted in moderate theoretical
      efficiency (+14.8+/-0.2) and intermediate acceptability (0.11-0.35). CONCLUSION: 
      A clear trade-off exists between the theoretical efficiency and acceptability of 
      dietary changes, with a graded broadening of the food repertoire.

      among Older Cancer Survivors Shows Feasibility, Satisfaction, and Promise in
      Improving Vegetable and Fruit Consumption, Reassurance of Worth, and the
      Trajectory of Central Adiposity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Holistic approaches are sought to improve lifestyle behaviors and
      health of cancer survivors long term. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore whether a
      home-based vegetable gardening intervention is feasible and whether it improves
      diet and other health-related outcomes among older cancer survivors. DESIGN: We
      conducted a feasibility trial in which cancer survivors were randomized to
      receive a year-long gardening intervention immediately or to a wait-list control 
      arm. Home visits at baseline and 1 year assessed physical performance,
      anthropometric indices, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes, and biomarkers.
      PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included 46 older (aged 60+ years) survivors
      of locoregionally staged cancers across Alabama from 2014 to 2016. Forty-two
      completed 1-year follow-up. INTERVENTION: Cooperative extension master gardeners 
      delivered guidance to establish three seasonal vegetable gardens at survivors'
      homes. Plants, seeds, and gardening supplies were provided. OUTCOMES: Primary
      outcomes were feasibility targets of 80% accrual and retention, and an absence of
      serious adverse events; other outcomes were secondary and explored potential
      benefits. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Baseline to follow-up changes were assessed
      within and between arms using paired t, McNemar's, and chi(2) tests. RESULTS:
      This trial proved to be safe and demonstrated 91.3% retention; 70% of
      intervention participants rated their experience as "excellent," and 85% would
      "do it again." Data suggest significantly increased reassurance of worth (+0.49
      vs -0.45) and attenuated increases in waist circumference (+2.30 cm vs +7.96 cm) 
      in the gardening vs control arms (P=0.02). Vegetable and fruit consumption
      increased by approximately 1 serving/day within the gardening arm from baseline
      to follow-up (mean [standard error]=1.34 [1.2] to 2.25 [1.9] servings/day;
      P=0.02)] compared to controls (1.22 [1.1] to 1.12 [0.7]; P=0.77; between-arm
      P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The home vegetable gardening intervention among older
      cancer survivors was feasible and suggested improvements in vegetable and fruit
      consumption and reassurance of worth; data also suggest attenuated increases in
      waist circumference. Continued study of vegetable gardening interventions is
      warranted to improve health, health behaviors, and well-being of older cancer
      survivors.

AB  - Data evaluating the effect of oleic-acid-enriched diets and outdoor rearing (with
      access to pasture) on the quality of Alentejano (AL) pork and fat are limited.
      The aim of this work was to study the effects of feeding low (LO) or high oleic
      acid (HO) diets to AL pigs reared in individual pens (IND) or outdoors (OUT) with
      access to pasture. Biceps femoris and dorsal subcutaneous fat (DSF) samples were 
      collected to analyse chemical composition and lipids fatty acid (FA) profile. The
      expression of seven genes involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis and FA transport, as
      well as two transcription factors were also evaluated in the muscle. B. femoris
      and DSF presented lower lipid content in OUT-reared than in IND-reared pigs. Two 
      genes involved in lipogenesis, ACACA and FASN, were under-expressed in B. femoris
      from OUT-reared pigs, while two involved in lipolysis, LPL and HSL were
      over-expressed. HO diet also significantly reduced FASN expression. Both rearing 
      system and diet affected the FA profile of tissues, particularly DSF. Overall,
      OUT-reared pigs presented lower n6 to n3 FA ratios in all tissues, and lower
      monounsaturated (MUFA) and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content in
      DSF. When compared to LO-fed ones, HO-fed pigs presented higher oleic acid
      proportions in all tissues, and lower SFA, higher MUFA and PUFA levels, as well
      as lower saturation, atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes in DSF. This study
      shows that rearing system and oleic acid supplementation have complementary
      effects and influence the nutritional quality of pork and DSF.

TI  - Structured advice provided by a dietitian increases adherence of consumers to
      diet and lifestyle changes and lowers blood low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL)-cholesterol: the Increasing Adherence of Consumers to Diet & Lifestyle
      Changes to Lower (LDL) Cholesterol (ACT) randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 197-208
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence from healthcare professionals suggest that consumer
      compliance to healthy diet and lifestyle changes is often poor. The present study
      investigated the effect of advice provided by a physician or dietitian on
      consumer adherence to these measures combined with consuming foods with added
      plant sterols (PS) with the aim of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C). METHODS: One hundred mildly-to-moderately hypercholesterolaemic
      individuals were enrolled into a parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled study. 
      Dietitians (dietitian group; DG) advised 50 individuals in six weekly
      face-to-face behavioural therapy sessions, whereas the other 50 received standard
      advice from physicians (physician group, PG). Both groups consumed foods with
      added PS (three servings a day) for 6 weeks. Subsequently, all individuals were
      followed-up for another 6 weeks under real-life conditions. Blood lipids were
      measured at baseline and weeks 6 and 12 and 3-day diet diaries were taken at
      weeks 1, 6 and 12. RESULTS: Individuals in the DG significantly improved their
      dietary habits, physical activity and increased PS intake compared to the PG.
      After 6 weeks, LDL-C decreased in both groups compared to baseline without any
      significant differences between groups. At week 12, LDL-C was further
      significantly improved only in the DG (P = 0.006) compared to week 6. Total
      cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides were significantly lower in the DG compared 
      to the PG at week 12 after adjusting for levels at week 6 (P < 0.001, P < 0.001
      and P = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although structured counselling by
      dietitians and common standard advice by physicians were equally effective with
      respect to improving blood cholesterol after 6 weeks, dietitians were more
      effective in the longer-term (i.e. 6 weeks after the end of the intervention
      period).

TI  - How immediate and significant is the outcome of training on diversified diets,
      hygiene and food safety? An effort to mitigate child undernutrition in rural
      Malawi.
PG  - 1156-1166
LID - 10.1017/S1368980017003652 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the impacts of training on nutrition,
      hygiene and food safety designed by the Nutrition Working Group, Child Survival
      Collaborations and Resources Group (CORE). DESIGN: Adapted from the 21d Positive 
      Deviance/Hearth model, mothers were trained on the subjects of appropriate
      complementary feeding, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, and
      aflatoxin contamination in food. To assess the impacts on child undernutrition, a
      randomised controlled trial was implemented on a sample of 179 mothers and their 
      children (<2 years old) in two districts of Malawi, namely Mzimba and Balaka.
      Settings A 21d intensive learning-by-doing process using the positive deviance
      approach. SUBJECTS: Malawian children and mothers. RESULTS:
      Difference-in-difference panel regression analysis revealed that the impacts of
      the comprehensive training were positive and statistically significant on the
      Z-scores for wasting and underweight, where the effects increased constantly over
      time within the 21d time frame. As for stunting, the coefficients were not
      statistically significant during the 21d programme, although the level of
      significance started increasing in 2 weeks, indicating that stunting should also 
      be alleviated in a slightly longer time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: The study clearly
      suggests that comprehensive training immediately guides mothers into improved
      dietary and hygiene practices, and that improved practices take immediate and
      progressive effects in ameliorating children's undernutrition.

AB  - Two experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that administering
      PGF2alpha concurrent with timed artificial insemination (AI) in lactating dairy
      cows would enhance pregnancy per AI (P/AI). In experiment 1, lactating Holstein
      cows (n=289) in one herd were enrolled after a non-pregnancy diagnosis (30-36d
      after AI) to synchronize subsequent ovulation before AI. Cows were assigned
      randomly to receive (im) 10mg of PGF2alpha concurrent with timed AI (Day 0;
      treatment) or no injection (control). Blood samples were collected on Days -3, 0,
      and 13 to determine serum concentrations of progesterone. Ovaries were scanned
      via transrectal ultrasonography to determine follicle diameters (Day -3),
      subsequent ovulation risk (Day 13), and total volume of luteal tissue (Day 13).
      Diagnosis of pregnancy occurred on Days 32 and 80 after AI. Ovulation risk
      post-AI exceeded 90% and did not differ between treatments. In addition,
      PGF2alpha treatment only numerically increased progesterone (5.7+/-0.3 vs.
      6.2+/-0.3ng/mL) or luteal tissue volume (8.9+/-0.4 vs. 9.8+/-0.5ng/mL) on Day 13 
      by 8.8% (P=.206) or 10.1% (P=.134) in control and treated cows, respectively.
      Pregnancy per AI at Days 32 (P=.50) and 80 (P=.33) did not differ between
      treatments. Cows with progesterone >0.5ng/mL at timed AI had reduced (P<.001)
      ovulation risk but risk was unaffected by treatment. In experiment 2, lactating
      dairy cows (n=1828) in two commercial dairy herds were enrolled at time of
      insemination (Day 0), and assigned randomly to treatment or control as described 
      in experiment 1. Initial (Days 32-35) and confirmed (Days 63-68) pregnancy
      diagnosis revealed no differences in P/AI or pregnancy loss. Pregnancy diagnosis 
      on Days 32-35 produced percentage increases in P/AI for primiparous compared with
      multiparous cows (20.8%; P=.002), for first-service compared with repeat-service 
      cows (26%; P=.001), and cows in one herd compared with the second herd (36%;
      P<.001). Pregnancy loss was greater (P=.001) for cows inseminated at first
      (10.0%) vs. later services (5.3%) but was unaffected by treatment. Cows treated
      with PGF2alpha in one herd produced more twins than control cows (11.7 vs. 3.2%),
      whereas no treatment difference was detected in the second herd (5.6 vs. 5.6%),
      respectively. We conclude that im treatment of lactating dairy cows with 10mg of 
      PGF2alpha concurrent with timed AI did not improve P/AI or embryo survival, but
      increased twinning in one herd.

TI  - Effect of pre-milking teat disinfection on clinical mastitis incidence in a dairy
      herd in Northern Queensland, Australia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a pre-milking teat disinfection protocol would reduce 
      the incidence of clinical mastitis by greater than 50%. METHODS: Two pre-milking 
      routines were compared in a natural exposure trial. Cows from a single dairy herd
      were randomly assigned to control (n = 246) and experimental (pre-milking teat
      disinfection [PMTD]; n = 244) groups. For cows in the control group, the
      pre-milking routine involved minimal teat-washing, except for cows with wet teat 
      contamination. For cows in the PMTD group, the pre-milking routine involved
      washing of all teats, dipping with a commercial 0.1% available iodine solution,
      allowing a minimum of 30 s contact time and then drying of the teats using
      disposable paper towel. Clinical cases encountered during the trial were recorded
      and pathogens were isolated from milk samples using standard laboratory methods. 
      RESULTS: The effect of PMTD was determined using multivariable binary logistic
      regression. Multiparous animals in the PMTD group had higher odds of experiencing
      clinical mastitis overall and of experiencing clinical mastitis caused by
      environmental pathogens (odds ratio (OR) 1.97 and 4.11, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 1.15-3.38 and 1.49-11.3, respectively). In primiparous animals, pre-milking 
      teat disinfection did not reduce the odds of clinical mastitis by greater than
      50% (OR 1.31, 95%CI 0.52-3.29). CONCLUSION: In this herd, PMTD increased the odds
      of clinical mastitis. The effectiveness of PMTD to prevent clinical mastitis in
      pasture-based systems is likely to vary greatly between herds. We therefore
      recommend against the wholesale use of this practice on Australian farms.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of stocking rate (SR)
      and animal genotype (BR) on milk production, body weight (BW), and body condition
      score (BCS) within intensive pasture-based systems. A total of 533 lactation
      records, from 246 elite genetic merit dairy cows were available for analysis; 68 
      Holstein-Friesian (HF) and 71 Jersey x Holstein-Friesian (JxHF) crossbred cows in
      each of 4 consecutive years (2013-2016, inclusive). Cows from each BR were
      randomly allocated to 1 of 3 whole-farm comparative SR treatments, low (LSR;
      1,200 kg of BW/ha), medium (MSR; 1,400 kg of BW/ha), and high (HSR; 1,600 kg of
      BW/ha), and remained in the same SR treatments for the duration of the
      experiment. The effects of SR, BR, and their interaction on milk production/cow
      and per hectare, BW, BCS, and grazing characteristics were analyzed. Total
      pasture utilization per hectare consumed in the form of grazed pasture increased 
      linearly as SR increased: least in LSR (10,237 kg of dry matter/ha), intermediate
      in MSR (11,016 kg of dry matter/ha), and greatest in HSR (11,809 kg of dry
      matter/ha). Milk and milk solids (MS) yield per hectare was greatest for HSR
      (15,942 and 1,354 kg, respectively), intermediate for MSR (14,191 and 1,220 kg,
      respectively), and least for LSR (13,186 and 1,139 kg, respectively) with similar
      trends evident for fat, protein, and lactose yield/ha. At higher SR (MSR and
      HSR), MS yield per kg of BW per ha was reduced (0.85 and 0.82 kg of MS/kg of BW, 
      respectively) compared with LSR (0.93 kg of MS/kg of BW/ha). Holstein-Friesian
      cows achieved fewer grazing days per hectare (-37 d), and produced more milk
      (+561 kg/ha) but less fat plus protein (-57 kg/ha) compared with JxHF cows; the
      JxHF cows were lighter. At similar BW per hectare, JxHF cows produced more fat
      plus protein/ha during the grazing season at low (1,164 vs. 1,113 kg), medium
      (1,254 vs. 1,185 kg), and high (1,327 vs. 1,380 kg) SR. In addition, JxHF cows
      produced more fat plus protein per kg of BW/ha (0.90 kg) compared with HF cows
      (0.84 kg). The results highlight the superior productive efficiency of high
      genetic potential crossbred dairy cows within intensive pasture-based production 
      systems.

TI  - Substantial Variability Across Individuals in the Vascular and Nutrigenomic
      Response to an Acute Intake of Curcumin: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201700418 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Curcumin exerts biological activities of interest in cardiovascular
      prevention. However, its vascular protective effect is still poorly investigated 
      in humans. The present study aims to assess vascular effect of an acute intake of
      curcumin and its nutrigenomic impact in circulating immune cells. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 18 healthy smokers
      consume a placebo or a 5-g curcumin. Before and 2 h after the intake, vascular
      function measurements are performed by using flow-mediated dilation (FMD). In
      addition, endothelial function in the microcirculation and blood pressure are
      evaluated. Plasma curcumin concentrations and changes in gene expression in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are analyzed. No significant effect of 
      curcumin on FMD is observed when considering the entire study population, mainly 
      due to a high interindividual variability. A subgroup analysis according to the
      gender or the cardiovascular-risk score reveals a significant effect of curcumin 
      on FMD in women and in subjects presenting lower cardiovascular risk. No change
      in gene expression is observed when data are analyzed for all volunteers but
      changes in expression are observed when analyzed according to gender.
      CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial highlights that a substantial variability in
      efficacy of curcumin exists across individuals.

TI  - Association of the Gly482Ser PPARGC1A gene variant with different cholesterol
      outcomes in response to two energy-restricted diets in subjects with excessive
      weight.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two
      PPARGC1A gene polymorphisms on metabolic outcomes in response to two
      energy-restricted diets. METHODS: A 4-mo nutritional intervention was conducted
      that involved two different hypo-energetic diets based on low-fat (LF) and
      moderately high-protein (MHP) dietary patterns. Unrelated subjects with excessive
      weight were genotyped for two PPARGC1A polymorphisms: Rs8192678 (Gly482Ser) and
      rs3755863 (G > A). Genotyping was performed by next-generation sequencing and
      haplotypes were screened. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests were 
      assessed with standardized methods. RESULTS: Different cholesterol outcomes were 
      observed by diet and Gly482Ser genotype. The Gly482 Gly homozygotes after an LF
      diet had lower reductions in total cholesterol (-9 mg/dL vs. -27 mg/dL; P =
      0.017) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-5 mg/dL vs. -18 mg/dL; P 
      = 0.016) than the subjects who were carriers of 482 Ser allele. However, this
      finding was not recorded in the MHP group where Gly482 Gly homozygotes underwent 
      similar cholesterol decreases as the 482 Ser allele carriers. Likewise, all
      genotype carriers had significant reductions in the frequencies of
      hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >/=200 mg/dL) except for Gly482 Gly
      homozygotes in the LF group. Meanwhile, the rs3755863 polymorphism and PPARGC1A
      haplotypes showed borderline effects with regard to cholesterol decreases.
      CONCLUSIONS: An energy-restricted MHP diet might be more beneficial than an LF
      diet to reduce serum cholesterol among subjects who are carriers of the PPARGC1A 
      Gly482Gly genotype. The analysis of this genetic variant might be the basis for a
      precise, nutrigenetic management of hypercholesterolemia based on genetic makeup.

AB  - The study aims at identifying some submergence-tolerant rice genotypes through
      morphological and molecular characterization and their genetic variability
      analysis. Ten rice genotypes including two submergence-tolerant checks, two
      susceptible varieties and six advanced lines were evaluated for submergence
      tolerance in the laboratory and in the field during January-December 2015. The
      experiment was conducted in the field following randomized complete block design 
      in a two-factor arrangement using five replications. Ten characters, viz. days to
      flowering, plant height, tiller number plant(-1), effective tiller plant(-1), and
      yield plant(-1) etc. were studied for four treatments. A significant
      genotypexenvironment interaction was observed for all traits studied in this
      experiment. The yield was reduced for all genotypes at a different level of
      submergence stress compared to control. Binadhan-11, Binadhan-12, RC 249 and RC
      251 showed tolerance, whereas RC 192, RC 193 and RC 225 showed moderate tolerance
      in submerged condition. The phenotypic coefficient of variance (PCV) was higher
      than the genotypic coefficient of variance (GCV) in all the studies traits. High 
      heritability (75-97%) was found for all traits. High heritability along with high
      genetic advance was found for days to flowering (45.55) and plant height (40.05).
      Molecular characterization of the used genotypes was done with three SSR markers 
      viz. RM 24, and submergence specific SC3 and SUB1. SC3 was found reliable for
      detection of submergence tolerant genotypes due to the highest gene diversity
      (0.840) compared to others. The banding pattern of the submergence specific
      markers SC3 and SUB1 identified in Binadhan-11, Binadhan-12, RC 192, RC 193, RC
      225, RC 227, RC 249, and RC 251, which possess the SUB1 gene. Finally, clustering
      also separates the tolerant genotypes from the susceptible by dividing them into 
      different clusters. The identified genotypes might be useful for the breeding
      programme for the development of submergence tolerant as well as resistant rice
      variety in Bangladesh.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL/SLL) is the most common adult
      leukemia in Western countries. Although it is mostly an indolent disease it is
      still incurable and with limited knowledge in relation to its etiology. We aim to
      confirm and quantify established risk factors for CLL/SLL using a multi-center
      epidemiological population-based case-control study on CLL/SLL as well as to
      explore new exposures inconclusively associated with CLL/SLL METHODS: Using the
      framework provided by the large MCC-Spain case-control study, we explored
      established and suggested risk factors associated with CLL/SLL using data
      collected through a face-to-face interview. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and
      confidence intervals (CI) adjusted by basic confounders, in 1,845 controls from
      the general population and 560 CLL/SLL from 5 different Spanish regions. RESULTS:
      Among the established risk factors, CLL/SLL cases were 3 times more likely to
      report first degree relatives with an hematological cancer (OR=3.11, 95% CI 2.10 
      to 4.61) and nearly twice likely to have ever worked in agriculture (OR=1.70, 95%
      CI=1.34 to 2.16). New findings suggest that women with CLL/SLL were more likely
      to have central obesity (OR=1.67 95% CI=1.12 to 2.48). An inverse association was
      found for current alcohol consumption (p-trend<0.016) and for type II diabetes.
      CONCLUSION: We confirmed previous established risk factors for CLL/SLL. Among the
      new findings, further research of central obesity as preventable exposure and the
      treatment for type II diabetes are warranted.

LID - 10.1080/14992027.2017.1374568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adolescent farmworkers are exposed to loud noise during farm
      activities. We present a prospective study that evaluated the efficacy of
      low-cost, technology-based intervention approaches in high schools to enhance the
      use of hearing protection among adolescent farmworkers. DESIGN: Six high schools 
      in Iowa that agreed to participate in the study were divided into three equal
      groups through cluster-randomisation with each group receiving one of the three
      formats of hearing protection intervention: (a) classroom training, (b) classroom
      training coupled with smartphone app training and (c) computer training.
      Participants completed baseline (pre-training) and six-week post-intervention
      surveys for assessing hearing protection knowledge, attitudes and behaviour.
      STUDY SAMPLE: Seventy participants from six schools were initially enrolled but
      50 completed both pre- and post-intervention surveys. RESULTS: In most cases, all
      three groups showed significant improvement in hearing protection knowledge,
      attitude and frequency of use from pre- to post-intervention. However, changes
      between groups were statistically non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although all
      three formats led to improvements on hearing protection knowledge, attitude and
      behaviour, the findings of the study, perhaps due to the small sample size, did
      not allow us to detect whether technology-based hearing protection interventions 
      were more effective than the traditional face-to-face training for adolescent
      farmworkers.

PG  - 224-234
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12681 [doi]
AB  - This study was designed to determine effects of quantitatively restricted intake 
      of the final finishing diet as a means of dietary adaptation compared with diets 
      increasing in concentrate (step up) over periods of 6 and 9 days on feedlot
      performance, carcass characteristics, feeding behaviour, blood gas profile and
      rumen morphometrics of Nellore cattle. One hundred twenty 22-month-old Nellore
      bulls (352 +/- 20 kg) were randomly allocated in 24 pens and fed for 84 days. The
      experimental design was a completely randomized block with 2 x 2 factorial
      arrangement of treatments: adaptation using either step up protocol for 6 days or
      9 days or restriction protocol for 6 days or 9 days, where the pen (five
      bullocks/pen; six pens/treatment) was considered the experimental unit. Cattle
      adapted by step up protocol had significantly greater average daily gain
      throughout the study when compared to those adapted by restriction protocol,
      regardless of adaptation length. During the adaptation period, a greater dry
      matter intake fluctuation was observed for animals maintained on restriction
      programme when compared to those adapted to the finishing diets using step up
      protocol. In addition, a protocol x length interaction for rumenitis scores was
      observed, where the level of injuries to the ruminal wall was significantly
      higher for the cattle adapted by restriction protocol for 9 days and lower for
      animals submitted for 9 days to the step up programme. Likewise, a protocol x
      length interaction for mitotic index was observed, in which cattle adapted by
      step up protocol for 9 days had lower numbers of cells in mitosis. Thus, the step
      up protocol led to better feedlot performance, and based on this fact, the length
      of 9 days promoted better rumen epithelium adaptation of Nellore cattle to
      high-concentrate diets.

AB  - Intramammary infusion of antimicrobials (IA) and application of an internal teat 
      sealant (ITS) at the end of the lactation is a common strategy to prevent and
      treat intramammary infections during the dry period. In heifers, precalving IA
      has been reported to improve udder health and milk quality; however, the effect
      of ITS in heifers housed in freestall barns is still unknown. The objective of
      this study was to investigate the effect of prepartum application of ITS or IA on
      udder health of dairy heifers. A total of 886 heifers were randomly allocated
      into 1 of 4 treatment groups when they were 245 +/- 3 d pregnant. Control heifers
      (CON) did not receive any treatment. Heifers in the ITS group received the
      application of ITS containing 2.6 g of bismuth subnitrate. Animals in the IA
      group received intramammary administration of 62.5 mg of amoxicillin. Heifers in 
      IA+ITS group received intramammary administration of amoxicillin followed by ITS 
      application. The follow-up period was 270 d in milk (DIM). Clinical mastitis was 
      diagnosed and treated by trained farm personnel throughout the study period.
      Composite milk somatic cell counts (SCC) were determined monthly for the first 9 
      mo of lactation by Dairy Herd Improvement Association. Subclinical mastitis was
      defined as a cow having a SCC >200,000 cells/mL for at least 1 test day and not
      diagnosed with clinical mastitis during the study period. At 7 +/- 3 DIM,
      composite milk samples were collected for bacteriological analysis for a subset
      of the study animals. The presence of pathogens in milk at 7 +/- 3 DIM was more
      frequently detected in the CON heifers compared with animals enrolled in the
      treatment groups. Heifers in IA+ITS group had a decreased incidence of clinical
      mastitis compared with CON heifers (12.9 vs. 21.4%). Additionally, the incidence 
      of subclinical mastitis was decreased for IA+ITS heifers compared with CON
      counterparts (20.1 vs. 43.8%). During the first 9 mo of lactation, IA and IA+ITS 
      heifers had lower SCC linear scores compared with ITS and CON counterparts.
      Although IA+ITS treatment successfully improved udder health, it did not result
      in better milk yield, fertility, and survivability. In conclusion, ITS alone was 
      not effective in improving udder health; however, the combination of ITS and IA
      decreased the incidence of clinical and subclinical mastitis during the first 9
      mo of lactation. Additionally, IA+ITS had a long-term effect on the SCC linear
      score throughout the study period.

TI  - The GReat-Child Trial: A Quasi-Experimental Intervention on Whole Grains with
      Healthy Balanced Diet to Manage Childhood Obesity in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
LID - E156 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu10020156 [doi]
AB  - Background: The GReat-Child Trial was a quasi-experimental intervention that has 
      emphasized whole grain as a strategy to manage childhood obesity. Methods: Two
      schools in Kuala Lumpur with similar demographic characteristics were assigned as
      intervention (IG) and control (CG). Eligibility criteria were overweight/obese
      children aged 9 to 11 years who had no serious co-morbidity. Children who
      reported consuming wholegrain foods in their 3-day diet-recall during screening
      were excluded. A total of 63 children (31 IG; 32 CG) completed the entire
      intervention program. The IG children underwent six 30-min nutrition education
      lessons and had school delivery of wholegrain food on a daily basis over a
      12-week period. Parents of IG children attended 1-h individual diet counseling.
      Anthropometric outcomes including BMI-for-age z-score (BAZ), body fat percentage 
      and waist circumference were measured at baseline [T0], post-intervention [T1]
      (3rd month) and follow-up [T2] (9th month). Results: IG showed significantly
      lower BAZ (weighted difference: -0.12; 95% CI: -0.21, -0.03; p = 0.009), body fat
      percentage (weighted difference: -2.6%; 95% CI: -3.7, -1.5; p < 0.001) and waist 
      circumference (weighted difference: -2.4 cm; 95% CI: -3.8, -1.0; p = 0.001)
      compared to CG. IG reported significantly lower body fat percentage (weighted
      difference: -3.4%; 95% CI: 1.8, 5.0; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (weighted
      difference: -2.1 cm; 95% CI: -3.7, -0.5; p = 0.014) at T1 compared to T0.
      Conclusions: The GReat-Child Trial made a positive impact in managing childhood
      obesity. It can be incorporated into childhood obesity intervention programs that
      are being implemented by the policy makers.

TI  - A Long-Term Follow-Up of the Efficacy of Nature-Based Therapy for Adults
      Suffering from Stress-Related Illnesses on Levels of Healthcare Consumption and
      Sick-Leave Absence: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - E137 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15010137 [doi]
AB  - Stress-related illnesses are a growing health problem in the Western world; which
      also has economic significance for society. As a consequence; there is a growing 
      demand for effective treatments. The study investigates the long-term efficacy of
      the Nacadia((R)) nature-based therapy (NNBT) by comparing it to the efficacy of a
      validated cognitive behavioral therapy, called STreSS. The study is designed as a
      randomized controlled trial in which 84 participants are randomly allocated
      between the treatments. Long-term efficacy is investigated through data extracts 
      from the national database of Statistics Denmark on the sick leave and the
      health-care consumption. The results show that both the NNBT and the STreSS lead 
      to a significant decrease in number of contacts with a general practitioner in
      the period from twelve months prior to treatment to twelve months after
      treatment; and, a significant decrease in long-term sick leave from the month
      prior to treatment to twelve months after treatment. The positive long-term
      effects provide validation for the NNBT as an efficient treatment of
      stress-related illnesses.

TI  - Effects of stacked wedge pads and chains applied to the forefeet of Tennessee
      Walking Horses for a five-day period on behavioral and biochemical indicators of 
      pain, stress, and inflammation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of stacked wedge pads and chains applied to
      the forefeet of Tennessee Walking Horses on behavioral and biochemical indicators
      of pain, stress, and inflamation. ANIMALS 20 Tennessee Walking Horses. PROCEDURES
      Horses were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: keg shoes (control; n = 10) 
      or stacked wedge pads and exercise with chains (10). Ten days before treatment
      application, an accelerometer was attached at the left metatarsus of each horse
      to record daily activity. Horses were exercised for 20 minutes daily, beginning
      on day -7. On day 0, exercise ceased, the forefeet were trimmed, and the assigned
      treatment was applied. From days 1 through 5, horses were exercised as before.
      Blood samples for measurement of plasma cortisol, substance P, and fibrinogen
      concentrations were collected on days -5, 1, and 5 before and after exercise and 
      every 30 minutes thereafter for 6 hours. RESULTS No significant differences in
      plasma concentrations of cortisol, substance P, and fibrinogen were detected
      between groups. Although lying behaviors changed after shoes were applied, these 
      behaviors did not differ significantly between groups. Shoeing appeared to have
      altered behavior to a greater extent than did the type of treatment applied.
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Application of stacked wedge pads and chains
      to the forefeet of horses for a 5-day period as performed in this study evoked no
      acute or subacute stress or nociceptive response as measured. Although these
      findings should not be extrapolated to the long-term use of such devices in
      Tennessee Walking Horses performing the running walk, the data should be
      considered when making evidence-based decisions relating to animal welfare and
      the use of stacked wedge pads and chains.

      Varying Socioeconomic Status?
PG  - 32-49
LID - 10.1080/03670244.2017.1406854 [doi]
AB  - Fruit and vegetable (F/V) intake is inadequate and obesity is more prevalent
      among adults of lower socioeconomic status (SES) in the United States. The effect
      of nutrition education and F/V supplementation on F/V intake and anthropometrics 
      of overweight or obese adults of varying SES was determined. F/V intake was not
      different between the nutrition education and F/V supplementation groups.
      Individuals with a graduate degree had significant improvements in fruit intake. 
      Few of the improvements in anthropometrics seen were significant. Future research
      should focus on specific barriers to F/V intake and include information on total 
      energy intake and expenditure.

AB  - Interventions addressing links between media exposure and obesity risk for
      school-age youth have not explicitly addressed the role of family communication
      about media. Youths' influence attempts on parents to purchase advertised foods
      can create conflict and negatively affect parental food choices. This study
      tested whether a family-based media literacy curriculum improves parents' media
      management skills and decreases youths' susceptibility to appealing but
      unrealistic food marketing. A matched-group pretest/posttest field experiment of 
      parent-youth dyads with control group (N = 100 dyads, youth M = 11 years of age) 
      tested the six-session curriculum. Hypotheses were analyzed using a Bayesian
      structural equation model. The curriculum increased parents' active negative
      mediation to foster youths' critical thinking about food marketing, b* = 0.35,
      95% CCI [0.17, 0.50], increased parent Efficacy for making healthy dietary
      changes for their families, b* = 0.59, 95% CCI [0.41, 0.75], and fostered family 
      discussion about nutrition labels (total effect = 0.22). Additionally, cumulative
      influences of Perceived Desirability and Wishful Identification on youths'
      requests for marketed foods were reduced (total effect = 0.04). Media literacy
      education can empower parents and improve youths' critical thinking to reduce
      effects of food marketing on families and improve use of media to obtain
      nutrition information.

TI  - Evaluation of a smartphone nutrition and physical activity application to provide
      lifestyle advice to pregnant women: The SNAPP randomised trial.
LID - 10.1111/mcn.12502 [doi]
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the impact of a smartphone application as an
      adjunct to face-to-face consultations in facilitating dietary and physical
      activity change among pregnant women. This multicentre, nested randomised trial
      involved pregnant women with a body mass index >/=18.5 kg/m(2) , with a singleton
      pregnancy between 10 and 20 weeks' gestation, and participating in 2 pregnancy
      nutrition-based randomised trials across metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. 
      All women participating in the SNAPP trial received a comprehensive dietary,
      physical activity, and behavioural intervention, as part of the GRoW or OPTIMISE 
      randomised trials. Women were subsequently randomised to either the "Lifestyle
      Advice Only Group," where women received the above intervention, or the
      "Lifestyle Advice plus Smartphone Application Group," where women were
      additionally provided access to the smartphone application. The primary outcome
      was healthy eating index (HEI) assessed by maternal food frequency questionnaire 
      completed at trial entry, and 28 and 36 weeks' gestation. Analyses were performed
      using intention-to-treat principles, with statistical significance at p = .05.
      One hundred sixty-two women participated: 77 allocated to the Lifestyle Advice
      plus Smartphone Application Group and 85 to the Lifestyle Advice Only Group. Mean
      difference in HEI score at 28 weeks of pregnancy was 0.01 (CI [-2.29, 2.62]) and 
      at 36 weeks of pregnancy -1.16 (CI [-4.60, 2.28]). There was no significant
      additional benefit from the provision of the smartphone application in improving 
      HEI score (p = .452). Although all women improved dietary quality across
      pregnancy, use of the smartphone application was poor. Our findings do not
      support addition of the smartphone application.

TI  - Nutrition behaviour change communication causes sustained effects on IYCN
      knowledge in two cluster-randomised trials in Bangladesh.
LID - 10.1111/mcn.12498 [doi]
AB  - Behaviour change communication (BCC) can improve infant and young child nutrition
      (IYCN) knowledge, practices, and health outcomes. However, few studies have
      examined whether the improved knowledge persists after BCC activities end. This
      paper assesses the effect of nutrition sensitive social protection interventions 
      on IYCN knowledge in rural Bangladesh, both during and after intervention
      activities. We use data from two, 2-year, cluster randomised control trials that 
      included nutrition BCC in some treatment arms. These data were collected at
      intervention baseline, midline, and endline, and 6-10 months after the
      intervention ended. We analyse data on IYCN knowledge from the same 2,341 women
      over these 4 survey rounds. We construct a number correct score on 18 IYCN
      knowledge questions and assess whether the impact of the BCC changes over time
      for the different treatment groups. Effects are estimated using ordinary least
      squares accounting for the clustered design of the study. There are 3 main
      findings: First, the BCC improves IYCN knowledge substantially in the 1st year of
      the intervention; participants correctly answer 3.0-3.2 more questions (36% more)
      compared to the non-BCC groups. Second, the increase in knowledge between the 1st
      and 2nd year was smaller, an additional 0.7-0.9 correct answers. Third, knowledge
      persists; there are no significant decreases in IYCN knowledge 6-10 months after 
      nutrition BCC activities ended.

TI  - A work-for-food enrichment program increases exploration and decreases
      stereotypies in four species of bears.
PG  - 3-15
LID - 10.1002/zoo.21391 [doi]
AB  - Zoo-housed bears are prone to exhibiting stereotypic behaviors, generally
      considered indicators of negative welfare. We explored the effects of a
      variable-time feeding enrichment schedule on behavioral indicators of welfare in 
      four bear species at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. We distributed the diets of eight 
      bears in one of five enrichment items, for two consecutive days each, and
      monitored behavior throughout the day. In Experiment 1, we compared variable-time
      to fixed-time presentation of enrichment over two, 10-day periods. Overall, bears
      performed more exploratory behavior when enriched (p < 0.0001). Furthermore,
      variable-time enrichment was associated with a greater increase in exploratory
      behavior than fixed-time enrichment when compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Both
      fixed-time (punadjusted <0.05, padjusted = 0.07) and variable-schedule
      (punadjusted <0.05, padjusted = 0.09) enrichment were also associated with
      similar decreases in abnormal behavior compared to baseline. For Experiment 2, we
      tested habituation to enrichment over 30 days using multiple items and a
      semi-variable presentation schedule. Again during the enrichment period, bears
      exhibited increased exploratory behavior (p < 0.0001) and decreased abnormal
      behaviors compared to baseline (punadjusted = 0.05, padjusted = 0.09). We
      observed no habituation during the 30-day sustained enrichment period for these
      behaviors. Collectively, these results suggest that daily, variable-schedule
      feeding enrichment, with intermittent presentation of unique enrichment items,
      increases behavioral indicators of positive welfare and decreases behavioral
      indicators of negative welfare.

TI  - The effects of olfactory stimulation on the behavior of captive ring-tailed
      lemurs (Lemur catta).
PG  - 16-22
LID - 10.1002/zoo.21392 [doi]
AB  - Ring-tailed lemurs reside in many animal collections worldwide. Lemur welfare may
      be a cause of concern due to some captive individuals exhibiting stereotypic
      behavior. Despite these concerns, there has been little exploration of methods of
      environmental enrichment for ring-tailed lemurs. Olfactory stimulation can
      enhance captive animal welfare by encouraging species-typical behaviors,
      enhancing behavioral diversity, and decreasing stereotypic behaviors. We aimed to
      investigate the effects of olfactory stimulation via lavender, peppermint,
      coconut, and prey odor upon the behavior of eight captive ring-tailed lemurs. We 
      exposed the lemurs to six individual odor conditions (odor control, novel object 
      control, lavender, peppermint, coconut, and Morio worms) and observed them for 4 
      hr a day for 3 days with an intervening period of 4 days between conditions. We
      recorded the lemurs' behavior under each condition using instantaneous scan
      sampling. We found significant effects of olfactory stimulation on the
      ring-tailed lemurs' behavior in the initial analysis but these did not survive
      correction for multiple testing. Overall, while our findings are suggestive of a 
      general effect of olfactory stimulation on the captive ring-tailed lemurs they
      did not indicate a marked influence of olfactory condition. However, further
      investigation with a larger sample size and more biologically relevant odors may 
      be beneficial to fully examine potential effects of olfactory stimulation in
      captive lemurs.

      Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla).
PG  - 23-34
LID - 10.1002/zoo.21393 [doi]
AB  - We investigated how forage material affects indicators of welfare in three male
      Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at the Detroit Zoo. In
      addition to their maintenance diet and enrichment foods, the gorillas generally
      received forage material four times a week. From this baseline, we systematically
      manipulated how much forage material the group received on a weekly basis, with
      either daily or bi (twice)-weekly presentation of browse (mulberry, Morus sp.) or
      alfalfa hay. We collected behavioral data (60 hr per gorilla) and measured fecal 
      glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM). Mixed models indicated that the presence of
      forage material significantly increased time feeding (F2,351 = 9.58, p < 0.001), 
      and decreased rates of noncontact aggression (F2,351 = 3.69, p = 0.03), and
      regurgitation and reingestion (F2,353 = 4.70, p = 0.01). Regurgitation and
      reingestion were never observed during the condition when forage material was
      provided daily. When forage material was provided, time spent feeding was similar
      across gorillas, compared to a disproportionately greater amount of time spent
      feeding by the dominant individual when forage material was absent. Providing
      forage material in addition to the regular diet likely created more opportunities
      for equitable feeding for the subordinate gorillas. FGM concentrations did not
      vary based on the presence or type of forage material available and, instead,
      likely reflected group social dynamics. In general, alfalfa and mulberry had
      similar impacts on behavior, indicating that alfalfa can be an adequate
      behavioral substitute during times when browse is less readily available for
      gorillas housed in seasonally variable climates.

TI  - Nutrition and Culinary in the Kitchen Program: a randomized controlled
      intervention to promote cooking skills and healthy eating in university students 
      - study protocol.
PG  - 83
LID - 10.1186/s12937-017-0305-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-based intervention studies that aim at developing cooking
      skills have increased in the scientific literature and are related to healthier
      food practices. However, methodological limitations are observed and only a few
      studies have university students as the target. The university entrance period
      has been related to negative changes in eating habits among young people and it
      represents an important period for developing interventions for health promotion.
      This study describes the study protocol and the evaluation framework for the
      Nutrition and Culinary in the Kitchen program. This program aims to develop
      cooking skills in university students, and is based on the Cooking with a Chef
      program in the United States. METHODS: This ongoing, randomized controlled
      intervention was designed with a six month follow-up study. The intervention
      consisted of three-hour weekly classes during a six week period with printed
      materials provided. Five of the classes were hands-on cooking and one was a tour 
      to a popular food market. There were eight primary outcome measures: changes in
      relation to i) accessibility and availability of fruits and vegetables; ii)
      cooking attitudes; iii) cooking behaviors at home; iv) cooking behaviors away
      from home; v) produce consumption self-efficacy; vi) self-efficacy for using
      basic cooking techniques; vii) self-efficacy for using fruits, vegetables, and
      seasonings (while cooking); and viii) knowledge of cooking terms and techniques. 
      Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index and in personal
      characteristics related to cooking. Repeated measures were collected through the 
      application of an online self-completed survey, at baseline, after intervention
      and six months after intervention. A sample of 80 university students (40:
      intervention group; 40: control group) was estimated to detect a mean change of
      1.5 points in cooking knowledge, with study power of 80%, and 95% level of
      confidence, plus 20% for random losses and 10% for confounding factors. The
      control group participants have continued with their usual activities. Data
      analyses will evaluate the intervention effect on changes in outcomes within and 
      between groups, as well as explore relations with personal characteristics.
      DISCUSSION: This method provides new evidence about whether or not a culinary
      intervention targeting university students has an impact on the improvement of
      cooking skills and healthy eating practices. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Brazilian

TI  - Effectiveness of home-based nutritional counselling and support on exclusive
      breastfeeding in urban poor settings in Nairobi: a cluster randomized controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1186/s12992-017-0314-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) improves infant health and survival. We
      tested the effectiveness of a home-based intervention using Community Health
      Workers (CHWs) on EBF for six months in urban poor settings in Kenya. METHODS: We
      conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Korogocho and Viwandani slums 
      in Nairobi. We recruited pregnant women and followed them until the infant's
      first birthday. Fourteen community clusters were randomized to intervention or
      control arm. The intervention arm received home-based nutritional counselling
      during scheduled visits by CHWs trained to provide specific maternal infant and
      young child nutrition (MIYCN) messages and standard care. The control arm was
      visited by CHWs who were not trained in MIYCN and they provided standard care
      (which included aspects of ante-natal and post-natal care, family planning,
      water, sanitation and hygiene, delivery with skilled attendance, immunization and
      community nutrition). CHWs in both groups distributed similar information
      materials on MIYCN. Differences in EBF by intervention status were tested using
      chi square and logistic regression, employing intention-to-treat analysis.
      RESULTS: A total of 1110 mother-child pairs were involved, about half in each
      arm. At baseline, demographic and socioeconomic factors were similar between the 
      two arms. The rates of EBF for 6 months increased from 2% pre-intervention to
      55.2% (95% CI 50.4-59.9) in the intervention group and 54.6% (95% CI 50.0-59.1)
      in the control group. The adjusted odds of EBF (after adjusting for baseline
      characteristics) were slightly higher in the intervention arm compared to the
      control arm but not significantly different: for 0-2 months (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.55
      to 2.96; p = 0.550); 0-4 months (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.54 to 2.42; p = 0.696), and
      0-6 months (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.02; p = 0.718). CONCLUSIONS: EBF for six
      months significantly increased in both arms indicating potential effectiveness of
      using CHWs to provide home-based counselling to mothers. The lack of any
      difference in EBF rates in the two groups suggests potential contamination of the
      control arm by information reserved for the intervention arm. Nevertheless, this 
      study indicates a great potential for use of CHWs when they are incentivized and 
      monitored as an effective model of promotion of EBF, particularly in urban poor
      settings. Given the equivalence of the results in both arms, the study suggests
      that the basic nutritional training given to CHWs in the basic primary health
      care training, and/or provision of information materials may be adequate in
      improving EBF rates in communities. However, further investigations on this may
      be needed. One contribution of these findings to implementation science is the
      difficulty in finding an appropriate counterfactual for community-based
      educational interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN83692672 . Registered

TI  - Effect of Peroral Administration of Chromium on Insulin Signaling Pathway in
      Skeletal Muscle Tissue of Holstein Calves.
PG  - 223-232
LID - 10.1007/s12011-017-1007-1 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of peroral
      administration of chromium-enriched yeast on glucose tolerance in Holstein
      calves, assessed by insulin signaling pathway molecule determination and
      intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Twenty-four Holstein calves, aged 1
      month, were chosen for the study and divided into two groups: the PoCr group (n =
      12) that perorally received 0.04 mg of Cr/kg of body mass daily, for 70 days, and
      the NCr group (n = 12) that received no chromium supplementation. Skeletal tissue
      samples from each calf were obtained on day 0 and day 70 of the experiment.
      Chromium supplementation increased protein content of the insulin beta-subunit
      receptor, phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 at Tyrosine 632,
      phosphorylation of Akt at Serine 473, glucose transporter-4, and AMP-activated
      protein kinase in skeletal muscle tissue, while phosphorylation of insulin
      receptor substrate 1 at Serine 307 was not affected by chromium treatment.
      Results obtained during IVGTT, which was conducted on days 0, 30, 50, and 70,
      suggested an increased insulin sensitivity and, consequently, a better
      utilization of glucose in the PoCr group. Lower basal concentrations of glucose
      and insulin in the PoCr group on days 30 and 70 were also obtained. Our results
      indicate that chromium supplementation improves glucose utilization in calves by 
      enhancing insulin intracellular signaling in the skeletal muscle tissue.

TI  - Effects of stocking density on lipid deposition and expression of lipid-related
      genes in Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii).
PG  - 1707-1720
LID - 10.1007/s10695-017-0403-y [doi]
AB  - To investigate the correlation between lipid deposition variation and stocking
      density in Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) and the possible physiological
      mechanism, fish were conducted in different stocking densities (LSD 5.5 kg/m(3), 
      MSD 8.0 kg/m(3), and HSD 11.0 kg/m(3)) for 70 days and then the growth index,
      lipid content, lipase activities, and the mRNA expressions of lipid-related genes
      were examined. Results showed that fish subjected to higher stocking density
      presented lower final body weights (FBW), specific growth ratio (SGR), and gonad 
      adipose tissue index (GAI) (P < 0.05). Lower lipid content was observed in the
      liver, gonad adipose tissue and muscle in sturgeons held in HSD group (P < 0.05).
      The serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased significantly with
      increasing stocking density, while no significant change was observed for
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Furthermore, the cDNAs encoding
      lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) were isolated in Amur sturgeon, 
      respectively. The full-length LPL cDNA was composed of 1757 bp with an open
      reading frame of 501 amino acids, while the complete nucleotide sequences of HL
      covered 1747 bp encoding 499 amino acids. In the liver, the activities and mRNA
      levels of LPL were markedly lower in HSD group, which were consistent with the
      variation tendency of HL. Fish reared in HSD group also presented lower levels of
      activities and mRNA expression of LPL in the muscle and gonad. Moreover, the
      expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in
      both the liver and skeletal muscle were significantly upregulated in HSD group.
      Overall, the results indicated that high stocking density negatively affects
      growth performance and lipid deposition of Amur sturgeon to a certain extent. The
      downregulation of LPL and HL and the upregulation of PPARalpha may be responsible
      for the lower lipid distribution of Amur sturgeon in higher stocking density.

TI  - Influence of immunostimulant polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and Bacillus strains
      on the innate immune and acute stress response in turbots (Scophthalmus maximus) 
      fed soy bean- and wheat-based diets.

AB  - Immunostimulants are widely applied in aquaculture practice and may have
      beneficial effects on the immune system and physical functions allowing higher
      tolerance to stress. In the current study, the impact of four (i-iv) dietary
      active ingredients on the immune and stress response of turbot was examined in
      two experiments (I and II). A basal low fish meal (FM; 32%) diet was formulated
      and supplemented with (i) yeast beta-glucan and mannan oligosaccharide (GM), (ii)
      alginic acid (AC), (iii) yeast nucleotides and RNA (NR), or (iv) Bacillus strains
      (BS). The basal diet (C-LF) and a high FM (59%) control (C-HF) were maintained.
      All six diets were fed to juvenile turbots for 84 days in experiment I and for
      additional 28 days prior to experiment II. Immunological and hematological
      parameters were determined in experiment I. In experiment II, physical stress
      response to a typical short-term (<1 day) aquaculture handling procedure
      (combination of capture, netting/transfer, and crowding) was investigated. For
      this, turbot blood was sampled before and at 0.5, 1, 4, and 24 h post stress.
      Plasma lysozyme activity, neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,
      and total plasma protein levels did not significantly differ between treatment
      groups; however, plasma cholesterol increased significantly in fish fed GM, AC,
      NR, and C-HF compared to C-LF (I). A significant increase in plasma glucose and
      triglyceride was observed in GM and NR treatments, while glucose levels were
      significantly higher in C-HF compared to C-LF. Moreover, the
      immunostimulant-supplemented diets exhibited significantly lower cortisol levels 
      compared to controls C-LF (at 0.5 h) and C-HF (at 1 h) post stress, respectively 
      (II). According to our findings, FM substitution did not modulate the innate
      immune response but was associated with reduced levels of cholesterol. Dietary
      immunostimulants were not effective enough to boost the immune response, but we
      believe they might be helpful to trigger metabolic advantages during stressful
      handling events on fish farms.

PG  - 1175-1184
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12636 [doi]
AB  - Sixty-four barrows with an initial body weight of 59.8 +/- 2.1 kg were allocated 
      to one of the two feeding frequency regimes (had free access to diet and fed two 
      meals per day). Pigs had free access (FA) to feed were fed on an ad libitum basis
      during the 8-week experimental period. Pigs fed twice daily (M2) were allowed to 
      consume their meals in 2 h. Pigs fed twice daily had lower average daily feed
      intake (p < 0.01) and average daily gain (p < 0.1), but a greater G:F (p < 0.05) 
      than FA pigs. Lower perirenal fat deposition, hot carcass weight, intramuscular
      fat content (p < 0.05) and dressing percentage (p < 0.1) were found in M2 pigs
      compared with FA pigs. Activities of citrate synthase, beta-hydroxylacyl-CoA
      dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were greater in the Longissimus muscle
      (LM) of M2 pigs compared with FA pigs (p < 0.05). Proteomic analysis revealed
      that expression abundances of proteins involved in glucose metabolism, energy
      production and lipid utilization were upregulated, but expression levels of
      proteins participating in protein and amino acid metabolism, stress response and 
      redox homeostasis were downregulated in the LM of M2 pigs than those in FA pigs
      (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the less meal frequency impairs growth rate, has
      marginal effects on carcass and meat quality traits and affects expression
      abundances of proteins in the LM of finishing pigs.

TI  - Effect of feeding complete feed block containing rumen protected protein,
      non-protein nitrogen and rumen protected fat on improving body condition and
      carcass traits of cull ewes.
PG  - 1147-1158
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12628 [doi]
AB  - Nutrient utilization, body condition and carcass traits of cull ewes were studied
      in three dietary regimens based on complete feed block (CFB) feeding to control
      (C) with rumen protected protein (RPP), CU [RPP + urea (6 g/kg)] and CUF [RPP +
      urea + rumen protected fat (RPF; 40 g/kg)]. The RPP component (g/kg) in C had 1% 
      formaldehyde-treated soy flakes 50, mustard cake 50 and sesame cake 30. The
      mustard and sesame cakes were replaced with urea on equivalent N basis in CU and 
      CUF. The ewes were offered ad libitum CFB composed (g/kg) of concentrate 650,
      roughage 300 and molasses 50. The digestibility of OM and EE was higher (p <
      0.05) in CUF than in CU and C, while that of NDF and ADF was lower (p < 0.05).
      The CP digestibility was higher in both CU and CUF. Utilization of N and Ca was
      higher (p < 0.05) in CUF compared with C and CU. Urinary purine derivatives
      analysis and microbial N synthesis were similar in all the groups. Blood glucose 
      concentration improved at 90 day compared with 0 day. Ruminal attributes showed a
      higher (p < 0.05) pH, total N, TCA precipitable N, entodiniomorphs and total
      ciliate population in CU and CUF than in the control. The CUF had higher (p <
      0.01) DM, digestible OM and ME intake, which resulted in higher (p < 0.05) weight
      gain and better feed efficiency. Ewes in all the groups showed an improvement in 
      carcass traits at 90 day. The pre-slaughter weight was higher (p < 0.05) and
      dissected and KOH bone content was lower in CUF. Thus, feeding of CFB with urea
      as a cheaper N source and RPF to enrich with energy supported the improved
      performance as evidenced from higher nutrient input, 'utilization and efficiency 
      with enhanced carcass traits' for better marketability and returns from cull
      ewes.

      obesity.
PG  - 281-288
LID - 10.1177/0260106017720350 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the positive effects of high-intensity training on weight
      management and health-related outcomes, it is postulated that high-intensity
      training may also induce oxidative stress, increasing hepatic damage. AIM: The
      aim of this study was to compare the effects of low versus high-intensity
      training on biomarkers related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in
      adolescents with obesity. METHODS: For this study 107 adolescents (15 +/- 1
      years) with obesity (BMI = 34.7 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2)) were randomized into
      High-Intensity Training (HIT, n = 31), Low-Intensity Training (LIT, n = 31) or
      Control Group (CG, n = 45). Adolescents from HIT and LIT received nutritional,
      psychological and clinical counseling. Blood lipids, Castelli risk index,
      glucose, insulin and hepatic enzymes were measured at baseline and after 12
      weeks. RESULTS: Castelli risk index 1 was reduced in all groups ( p < 0.001) with
      moderate effect size ( d) for HIT ( d = 0.62) and LIT ( d = 0.66). Castelli risk 
      index 2 also decreased ( p < 0.001 for all groups; HIT d = 0.65; LIT d = 0.79).
      High-density lipoprotein increased in all groups ( d = 0.25 and d = 0.18 in HIT
      and LIT), while alanine aminotransferase tended to reduce ( p = 0.062) in HIT ( d
      = 0.34) and LIT ( d = 0.73) and aspartate aminotransferase decreased ( p = 0.024)
      in both HIT ( d = 0.24) and LIT ( d = 0.45). There were no changes in glucose,
      insulin and insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Both high and low-intensity training 
      improved biomarkers related to NAFLD. Thus, high-intensity training can be a safe
      and effective alternative to prevent and treat NAFLD in adolescents with obesity.

AB  - This research aimed to test the effects of lactobacilli, applied to cultured
      pike-perch, either through hydrolyzed OTOHIME fish diet, or through Artemia
      nauplii, on fish growth, microbiota balance and skeletal development. On the 12th
      Day Post Hatching (DPH) fish were divided into following treatment groups: two
      groups received the combination of OTOHIME and nauplii enriched either with
      Lactobacillus paracasei BGHN14+Lactobacillus rhamnosus BGT10 or with
      Lactobacillus reuteri BGGO6-55+Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, and one group
      received OTOHIME hydrolyzed by BGHN14+BGT10 and non-enriched nauplii. Control
      group received non-enriched nauplii and non-hydrolyzed OTOHIME. The treatment
      lasted 14days and fish were sacrificed on the 26th DPH for the assessment of
      digestive enzyme activity and microbiota composition. Individual total lengths
      and individual body weights were recorded at the end of the treatments, on the
      26th DPH, and also on the 45th DPH, in parallel with the evaluation of skeletal
      deformities and fish survival. Our results indicated positive effect of Artemia
      enriched with BGGO6-55+BGHO1 on fish growth, skeletal development and trypsin to 
      chymotrypsin activity ratio (T/C), as an indicator of protein digestibility.
      Hydrolysis of OTOHIME was also associated with better skeletal development,
      higher T/C values and lower levels of Aeromonas and Mycobacterium spp., which are
      important fish pathogens. Though additional testing in larger cohort studies is
      needed, these observations are promising in terms of usage of probiotics for
      improved environmentally friendly production of pike-perch in Recirculating
      Aquaculture System (RAS).

TI  - Leaves from banana (Musa nana) and maize (Zea mays) have no phyto-prophylactic
      effects on the susceptibility of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) to
      Aeromonas hydrophila infection.
PG  - 329
LID - 10.1186/s12917-017-1255-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ubiquitous and opportunistic bacterial pathogen Aeromonas
      hydrophila has been associated with ulcerative dermatitis in fish, especially
      under stressful conditions. It can cause severe losses in fresh water aquaculture
      and is particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. Fresh leaves
      from maize and bananas have been used as feed supplement by fish farmers in
      Vietnam and it has been reported that they may have phyto-prophylactic benefits. 
      In the present study, a feeding trial was conducted to investigate the benefits
      of providing maize and banana leaves as feed supplement: to determine if they
      were taken up and digested by grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), if this
      uptake resulted in improved growth performance, and if leaf supplementation
      protected fish when challenged with A. hydrophila by intramuscular injection.
      RESULTS: All fish were fed an identical ratio of commercial pelleted feed
      relative to biomass. However, in 12/18 tanks, this diet was supplemented with
      either fresh banana leaves or fresh maize leaves; offered ad libitum. Addition of
      leaves increased the overall feed conversion ratio (FCR) significantly. However, 
      if only the pellet were taken into account, then no difference was found between 
      treatments. Changes to the isotopic composition of the fish showed leaf nutrient 
      uptake occurred. No prophylactic effects of feeding banana or maize leaves were
      detected against infection with A. hydrophila, and the diet did not induce
      changes in the fish haematocrit. However, addition of the maize leaves was
      associated with significantly reduced severity of the skin lesions, which could
      improve the market value of the fish. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of the leaf
      supplement did not result in significantly improved growth performance.
      Similarly, the effect of the supplement on the fish survival to infection was not
      significant.

TI  - Evaluation of Commercial beta-Agonists, Dietary Protein, and Shade on Fecal
      Shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 from Feedlot Cattle.
PG  - 649-655
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2017.2313 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a foodborne pathogen commonly associated with cattle 
      feces. Diet, including dietary supplements such as beta-agonists, may impact
      fecal shedding of this pathogen. A series of three experiments were conducted to 
      determine if the beta-agonists ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) or zilpaterol
      hydrochloride (ZH) would impact the level or prevalence of fecal E. coli O157:H7 
      shedding. In Experiment 1, dietary RAC did not impact fecal shedding of E. coli
      O157:H7 based on the level or prevalence, but the addition of dietary soybean
      meal (SBM) in the study did reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding. In Experiments 2 and
      3, dietary ZH did not affect fecal E. coli O157:H7 shedding as determined by
      enumeration or prevalence, but in Experiment 2 the addition of 30% (dry matter
      basis) wet distillers grains with solubles (WDGS) in the diet tended to increase 
      E. coli O157:H7 shedding. Shade is a potential management tool to reduce heat
      stress in cattle, and in Experiment 3 the presence of shade over the feedlot pens
      did not affect E. coli O157:H7 shedding. The use of beta-agonists in cattle diets
      did not significantly affect fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7, and in particular
      the percentage of animals shedding enumerable levels of the pathogen did not
      change, indicating that there was not a change in colonization. As has been
      reported previously and indicated again in this study, the use of WDGS in the
      diet may increase E. coli O157:H7 shedding. In contrast, the addition of SBM to
      cattle diets, to increase the dietary crude protein, appeared to reduce E. coli
      O157:H7 shedding, but this potential dietary intervention needs to be confirmed
      with additional research.

TI  - Lower education predicts poor response to dietary intervention in pregnancy,
      regardless of neighbourhood affluence: secondary analysis from the ROLO
      randomised control trial.
PG  - 2959-2969
LID - 10.1017/S1368980017001951 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if response to a low glycaemic index (GI) dietary
      intervention, measured by changes in dietary intake and gestational weight gain, 
      differed across women of varying socio-economic status (SES). DESIGN: Secondary
      data analysis of the ROLO randomised control trial. The intervention consisted of
      a two-hour low-GI dietary education session in early pregnancy. Change in GI was 
      measured using 3 d food diaries pre- and post-intervention. Gestational weight
      gain was categorised as per the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines. SES was
      measured using education and neighbourhood deprivation. SETTING: The National
      Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. SUBJECTS: Women (n 625) recruited to the
      ROLO randomised control trial. RESULTS: The intervention significantly reduced GI
      and excess gestational weight gain (EGWG) among women with third level education 
      residing in both disadvantaged (GI, mean (sd), intervention v. control: -3.30
      (5.15) v. -0.32 (4.22), P=0.024; EGWG, n (%), intervention v. control: 7 (33.6)
      v. 22 (67.9); P=0.022) and advantaged areas (GI: -1.13 (3.88) v. 0.06 (3.75),
      P=0.020; EGWG: 41 (34.1) v. 58 (52.6); P=0.006). Neither GI nor gestational
      weight gain differed between the intervention and control group among women with 
      less than third level education, regardless of neighbourhood deprivation.
      CONCLUSIONS: A single dietary education session was not effective in reducing GI 
      or gestational weight gain among less educated women. Multifaceted, appropriate
      and practical approaches are required in pregnancy interventions to improve
      pregnancy outcomes for less educated women.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize post-operative outcomes of
      chemical castration as compared to surgical castration performed by existing
      municipal field clinics. Fifty-four healthy adult male dogs underwent chemical
      castration with zinc gluconate solution and 55 healthy adult male dogs underwent 
      surgical castration in veterinary field clinics. Dogs in each group were
      evaluated for swelling, inflammation, and ulceration (chemical castration) or
      dehiscence (surgical castration) at Days 3, 7, and 14 following castration. More 
      surgically castrated dogs required medical intervention than chemically castrated
      dogs (P=0.0328); the number of dogs requiring surgical repair within each group
      did not differ (P=0.3421). Seven chemically castrated dogs and 22 surgically
      castrated dogs experienced swelling, inflammation, and/or ulceration; all were
      managed medically. Two chemically castrated dogs experienced scrotal ulceration
      requiring surgical castration at Days 3 and 7. One surgically castrated dog
      experienced partial incisional dehiscence requiring surgical repair at Day 3. Our
      results suggest that chemical castration of dogs in field clinics is a feasible
      alternative to surgical castration, but proper follow-up care should be ensured
      for at least 7days post-procedurally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disinvestment (removal, reduction, or reallocation) of routinely
      provided health services can be difficult when there is little published evidence
      examining whether the services are effective or not. Evidence is required to
      understand if removing these services produces outcomes that are inferior to
      keeping such services in place. However, organisational imperatives, such as
      budget cuts, may force healthcare providers to disinvest from these services
      before the required evidence becomes available. There are presently no
      experimental studies examining the effectiveness of allied health services (e.g.,
      physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social work) provided on weekends
      across acute medical and surgical hospital wards, despite these services being
      routinely provided internationally. The aim of this study was to understand the
      impact of removing weekend allied health services from acute medical and surgical
      wards using a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority research design. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We conducted 2 stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trials
      between 1 February 2014 and 30 April 2015 among patients on 12 acute medical or
      surgical hospital wards spread across 2 hospitals. The hospitals involved were 2 
      metropolitan teaching hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Data from n = 14,834
      patients were collected for inclusion in Trial 1, and n = 12,674 in Trial 2.
      Trial 1 was a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority stepped-wedge trial where
      the 'current' weekend allied health service was incrementally removed from
      participating wards each calendar month, in a random order, while Trial 2 used a 
      conventional non-inferiority stepped-wedge design, where a 'newly developed'
      service was incrementally reinstated on the same wards as in Trial 1. Primary
      outcome measures were patient length of stay (proportion staying longer than
      expected and mean length of stay), the proportion of patients experiencing any
      adverse event, and the proportion with an unplanned readmission within 28 days of
      discharge. The 'no weekend allied health service' condition was considered to be 
      not inferior if the 95% CIs of the differences between this condition and the
      condition with weekend allied health service delivery were below a 2% increase in
      the proportion of patients who stayed in hospital longer than expected, a 2%
      increase in the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days, a 2% 
      increase in the proportion who had any adverse event, and a 1-day increase in the
      mean length of stay. The current weekend allied health service included physical 
      therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, dietetics, social work, and allied
      health assistant services in line with usual care at the participating sites. The
      newly developed weekend allied health service allowed managers at each site to
      reprioritise tasks being performed and the balance of hours provided by each
      professional group and on which days they were provided. Analyses conducted on an
      intention-to-treat basis demonstrated that there was no estimated effect size
      difference between groups in the proportion of patients staying longer than
      expected (weekend versus no weekend; estimated effect size difference [95% CI],
      p-value) in Trial 1 (0.40 versus 0.38; estimated effect size difference 0.01
      [-0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.31, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin),
      but the proportion staying longer than expected was greater with the newly
      developed service compared to its no weekend service control condition (0.39
      versus 0.40; estimated effect size difference 0.02 [0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.04, CI
      was completely below non-inferiority margin) in Trial 2. Trial 1 and 2 findings
      were discordant for the mean length of stay outcome (Trial 1: 5.5 versus 6.3
      days; estimated effect size difference 1.3 days [0.9 to 1.8], p < 0.001, CI was
      both above and below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: 5.9 versus 5.0 days;
      estimated effect size difference -1.6 days [-2.0 to -1.1], p < 0.001, CI was
      completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between
      conditions for the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days in 
      either trial (Trial 1: 0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.18, CI was both above and
      below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: -0.01 [-0.02 to 0.01], p = 0.62, CI
      completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between
      conditions in the proportion of patients who experienced any adverse event in
      Trial 1 (0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.33, CI was both above and below
      non-inferiority margin), but a lower proportion of patients had an adverse event 
      in Trial 2 when exposed to the no weekend allied health condition (-0.03 [-0.05
      to -0.004], p = 0.02, CI completely below non-inferiority margin). Limitations of
      this research were that 1 of the trial wards was closed by the healthcare
      provider after Trial 1 and could not be included in Trial 2, and that both
      withdrawing the current weekend allied health service model and installing a new 
      one may have led to an accommodation period for staff to adapt to the new service
      settings. Stepped-wedge trials are potentially susceptible to bias from naturally
      occurring change over time at the service level; however, this was adjusted for
      in our analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In Trial 1, criteria to say that the no weekend
      allied health condition was non-inferior to current weekend allied health
      condition were not met, while neither the no weekend nor current weekend allied
      health condition demonstrated superiority. In Trial 2, the no weekend allied
      health condition was non-inferior to the newly developed weekend allied health
      condition across all primary outcomes, and superior for the outcomes proportion
      of patients staying longer than expected, proportion experiencing any adverse
      event, and mean length of stay. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand

TI  - Effectiveness of household lockable pesticide storage to reduce pesticide
      self-poisoning in rural Asia: a community-based, cluster-randomised controlled
      trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Agricultural pesticide self-poisoning is a major public health
      problem in rural Asia. The use of safer household pesticide storage has been
      promoted to prevent deaths, but there is no evidence of effectiveness. We aimed
      to test the effectiveness of lockable household containers for prevention of
      pesticide self-poisoning. METHODS: We did a community-based, cluster-randomised
      controlled trial in a rural area of North Central Province, Sri Lanka. Clusters
      of households were randomly assigned (1:1), with a sequence computer-generated by
      a minimisation process, to intervention or usual practice (control) groups.
      Intervention households that had farmed or had used or stored pesticide in the
      preceding agricultural season were given a lockable storage container. Further
      promotion of use of the containers was restricted to community posters and
      6-monthly reminders during routine community meetings. The primary outcome was
      incidence of pesticide self-poisoning in people aged 14 years or older during 3
      years of follow-up. Identification of outcome events was done by staff who were
      unaware of group allocation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT1146496. FINDINGS: Between Dec 31, 
      2010, and Feb 2, 2013, we randomly assigned 90 rural villages to the intervention
      group and 90 to the control group. 27 091 households (114 168 individuals) in the
      intervention group and 26 291 households (109 693 individuals) in the control
      group consented to participate. 20 457 household pesticide storage containers
      were distributed. In individuals aged 14 years or older, 611 cases of pesticide
      self-poisoning had occurred by 3 years in the intervention group compared with
      641 cases in the control group; incidence of pesticide self-poisoning did not
      differ between groups (293.3 per 100 000 person-years of follow-up in the
      intervention group vs 318.0 per 100 000 in the control group; rate ratio [RR]
      0.93, 95% CI 0.80-1.08; p=0.33). We found no evidence of switching from pesticide
      self-poisoning to other forms of self-harm, with no significant difference in the
      number of fatal (82 in the intervention group vs 67 in the control group; RR
      1.22, 0.88-1.68]) or non-fatal (1135 vs 1153; RR 0.97, 0.86-1.08) self-harm
      events involving all methods. INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that means
      reduction through improved household pesticide storage reduces pesticide
      self-poisoning. Other approaches, particularly removal of highly hazardous
      pesticides from agricultural practice, are likely to be more effective for
      suicide prevention in rural Asia. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, with additional

TI  - Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Genetic Background Roles within a Web-Based
      Nutritional Intervention: The Food4Me Study.
LID - E1107 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu9101107 [doi]
AB  - Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) adherence has been proven to produce numerous health
      benefits. In addition, nutrigenetic studies have explained some individual
      variations in the response to specific dietary patterns. The present research
      aimed to explore associations and potential interactions between MedDiet
      adherence and genetic background throughout the Food4Me web-based nutritional
      intervention. Dietary, anthropometrical and biochemical data from volunteers of
      the Food4Me study were collected at baseline and after 6 months. Several genetic 
      variants related to metabolic risk features were also analysed. A Genetic Risk
      Score (GRS) was derived from risk alleles and a Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS),
      based on validated food intake data, was estimated. At baseline, there were no
      interactions between GRS and MDS categories for metabolic traits. Linear mixed
      model repeated measures analyses showed a significantly greater decrease in total
      cholesterol in participants with a low GRS after a 6-month period, compared to
      those with a high GRS. Meanwhile, a high baseline MDS was associated with greater
      decreases in Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference and glucose. There also
      was a significant interaction between GRS and the MedDiet after the follow-up
      period. Among subjects with a high GRS, those with a high MDS evidenced a highly 
      significant reduction in total carotenoids, while among those with a low GRS,
      there was no difference associated with MDS levels. These results suggest that a 
      higher MedDiet adherence induces beneficial effects on metabolic outcomes, which 
      can be affected by the genetic background in some specific markers.

AB  - The main aim of the present study was to assess the effects of chronic high
      stocking density on liver proteome of rainbow trout. Rainbow trout juveniles
      (42.6 +/- 2.3 g average body weight) were randomly distributed into six tanks at 
      two stocking densities (low stocking density (LD) = 20 kg m(-3) and high stocking
      density (HD) = 80 kg m(-3)). Both treatments were performed in triplicate tanks
      for a period of 60 days. High stocking density caused a reduction in the growth
      performance compared with LD fish. Lysozyme activity increased with stocking
      density, while serum complement activity presented the opposite pattern. Serum
      cortisol and total protein levels did not show significant differences (P > 0.05)
      between experimental groups. The fish reared at high stocking density showed
      significantly lower osmolality and globulin values but higher albumin level. The 
      HD group had significantly higher activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase 
      and superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde content in the liver when compared 
      to the LD group. Comparative proteomics was used to determine the proteomic
      responses in livers of rainbow trout reared at high stocking density for 60 days.
      Out of nine protein spots showing altered abundance (>1.5-folds, P < 0.05), eight
      spots were successfully identified. Two proteins including apolipoprotein A-I-2
      precursor and mitochondrial stress-70 protein were found to increase in HD group.
      The spots found to decrease in the HD group were identified as follows:
      2-peptidylprolyl isomerase A, two isoforms of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
      dehydrogenase, an unnamed protein product similar to fructose-bisphosphate
      aldolase, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, and serum albumin 1 protein.

TI  - Dietary integration with oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) essential oil improves
      growth rate and oxidative status in outdoor-reared, but not indoor-reared, pigs.
PG  - e352-e361
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12612 [doi]
AB  - The effects of a diet supplemented with oregano essential oil on performance,
      oxidative status, pork quality traits and sensorial properties were evaluated. In
      two studies, 72 pigs in indoor or outdoor conditions were assigned to either a
      control diet or an identical diet supplemented with 0.2% oregano essential oil.
      Pigs reared outdoor showed lower live weight, average daily gain and average
      gain:feed ratio compared to indoor pigs. The oregano supplementation improved the
      growth performance of the outdoor- but not the indoor-reared animals. The serum
      oxidative status was influenced by the diet. A higher oxidative stability was
      observed in the oregano-supplemented groups. As for the rearing conditions, the
      data suggest that after an initial adapting period, the free-range farming
      systems could be better tolerated by pigs. Meat derived from pigs reared outdoor 
      showed higher pH and a* values. Lightness was influenced by both the diet and the
      rearing conditions. The control group reared indoor showed shear force values
      higher than both supplemented groups, while no differences were detected with the
      control group reared outdoor. In the consumer test performed under blind
      conditions, the oregano groups achieved higher consistency scores compared with
      the control. Under informed conditions, the meat derived from the
      oregano-supplemented pigs reared outdoor received the highest scores for
      consistency and overall liking regardless of the rearing system. The same result 
      for the overall liking score was obtained in the expectation test. The data
      obtained showed that dietary oregano essential oil can be effective in reducing
      performance losses due to the outdoor-rearing system, increasing the oxidative
      status of the animal and oxidative stability of the meat, without modifying the
      meat quality traits and improving consumer perceptions of the meat quality.

TI  - Productive performance of weanling piglets was improved by administration of a
      mixture of bacteriophages, targeted to control Coliforms and Clostridium spp.
      shedding in a challenging environment.
PG  - e98-e107
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12567 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of bacteriophages in
      different environments on growth performance, digestibility, ileal and caecal
      microbiota, gut morphology and immunity of weanling pigs. Two hundred piglets
      were randomly assigned to four treatment groups with five replicate pens with 10 
      pigs per pen. A 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used to investigate
      the response of weanling pigs to supplemental bacteriophages (0 and 1.0 g/kg of
      diet) in contaminated or hygienic environments. Bacteriophages supplementation
      did not affect average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and
      gain:feed in phases I and III; however, there was a significant improvement in
      ADG and gain:feed in phase II. The supplementation of bacteriophages increased
      the overall gain:feed of pigs. The overall result showed a greater ADG and ADFI
      in hygienic room. There were reductions in population of both ileal (p < 0.05)
      and caecal (p < 0.01) Clostridium spp. and ileal coliforms (p < 0.01) with the
      inclusion of bacteriophages in the diet. Bacteriophages increased ileal
      Lactobacillus and caecal Bifidobacterium and tended to increase ileal
      Bifidobacterium (p = 0.08). Contaminated environment decreased ileal
      Lactobacillus and caecal Bifidobacterium and tended to increase ileal Clostridium
      (p = 0.08) and coliforms (p = 0.08). Total anaerobic bacteria was tended to
      decrease (p = 0.06) in contaminated environment. Jejunal villus height increased 
      in pigs received bacteriophages, but they did not affect other morphological
      items. The interaction between bacteriophages and environment tended to be
      significant (p = 0.06) for ileal villus height and ileal villus height to crypt
      depth ratio. The overall faecal score was significantly greater in hygienic
      environment and bacteriophages groups. The present findings indicate that there
      is an interactive effect on feed efficiency between bacteriophages and
      contaminated environment. In addition, bacteriophages improve jejunum morphology,
      and intestinal microbiota of pigs.

TI  - Effect of system of lamb rearing and season on early post-partum fertility of
      ewes and growth performance of lambs in Katahdin sheep.
PG  - e21-e30

AB  - The effect of season (S), lamb rearing system (RT) and grain supplementation (GS)
      on post-partum fertility in Katahdin ewes and growth in Katahdin lambs was
      evaluated. Katahdin ewes were bred to lamb in fall (n = 36) or spring (n = 56)
      and at approximately 2.5 months post-partum were randomly assigned to be
      permanently separated or to continue to suckle their lambs for an additional 3
      months. All ewes were joined with rams following treatment to synchronize
      oestrus. Weaned (W, n = 84) and continuously suckled lambs (CSK, n = 88) were fed
      forage only (n = 84; hay and pasture for fall- and spring-born lambs
      respectively) or were supplemented (n = 88; 18% crude protein ration ad libitum) 
      and all weighed biweekly. Ewes rebred in the fall had a shorter ram introduction 
      to lambing interval (p < 0.05), higher prolificacy (p = 0.001) and higher lambing
      rates (p = 0.02); however, the proportion of ewes lambing was not affected by
      season. The first service lambing rate was lower in ewes continuously suckling
      lambs in the spring, but not in the fall breeding season (S x RT, p = 0.03).
      Lambs that continuously suckled their dams and were supplemented grew quicker and
      gained more (p < 0.001) than their weaned and unsupplemented counterparts. The
      effect of CSK on growth rate of lambs was greater in the spring (RT x S; p =
      0.05), and the effect of supplementation on growth rate of lambs was greater in
      the fall (GS x S; p < 0.0001). In conclusion, Katahdin lambs achieved higher
      weight gains from continuous suckling and grain supplementation. Moreover,
      Katahdin ewes are capable of early rebreeding post-partum while suckling their
      lambs, which makes them suited for use in accelerated lambing programmes.

TI  - Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) drinking preferences: do nipple drinkers compensate 
      for behaviourally deficient diets?
PG  - 1046-1056
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12549 [doi]
AB  - When offered diets with hay ad libitum, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) clearly
      prefer open dishes over nipple drinkers, but whether this preference also applies
      in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) is unsure. We tested the drinker preference of
      10 guinea pigs when offered open dishes (OD) and nipple drinkers (ND)
      simultaneously and measured the amount of water consumed by each animal on four
      different diets (grass hay 100%, or as 10% of intake on diets of fresh parsley,
      seed mix or pelleted complete feed, respectively) on either of the drinking
      systems. All animals ingested the hay portion of the combined diets first. The
      amount of water consumed differed significantly between individual animals.
      Animals drank less water on parsley than on the other diets. Nine of 10 animals
      clearly preferred ND when having a choice, and eight of these drank more when on 
      ND only. The difference between the drinking systems was not consistent across
      all diets: on hay, similar amounts of water were drunk when on OD or ND only.
      Differences in water intake were reflected in urine production. Because drinking 
      from ND in guinea pigs involves jaw movements similar to those in chewing, the
      results could suggest that when motivation for oral processing behaviour is not
      satisfied by a diet, animals may respond in using ND beyond physiological water
      necessity. Whereas physiological water requirements are probably better
      investigated with other drinking systems due to a possible overestimation when
      using ND, offering ND to pet guinea pigs most likely offers a form of behavioural
      enrichment that at the same time may increase water intake and hence act as
      prophylaxis against urolithiasis.

TI  - Nutritional strategies to cope with reduced litter weight gain and total tract
      digestibility in lactating sows.
PG  - 914-924
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12523 [doi]
AB  - Twelve lactating sows were used to evaluate the effects of reducing dietary crude
      protein (CP) (14% vs. 12%) and increasing neutral detergent fibre (NDF) levels
      (18% vs. 22%) on litter performance, total tract apparent digestibility and
      manure composition in a 4 x 4 latin square arrangement during a 36-day lactation 
      period. Diets were isoenergetic (2.9 Mcal ME/kg) and had similar total lysine
      content (0.9%). In addition, a second aim was to compare a reference external
      marker method (Cr2 O3 ) with an internal feed marker [acid-insoluble ash (AIA)]
      for the calculation of apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients in
      lactating sows. The reduction of dietary CP level in lactating sows had no effect
      on either live-weight or backfat thickness or apparent total tract digestibility 
      of nutrients. However, the piglets' average daily gain (ADG) was reduced in low
      dietary CP diets, which suggests that sows reduced milk production due to an
      underestimation of certain essential amino acid requirements (e.g. valine). The
      increase of dietary NDF level did not affect sow and litter performance.
      Nevertheless, the total tract apparent digestibility of organic matter, CP and
      carbohydrates was reduced, and ether extract digestion was increased in high NDF 
      compared to normal NDF diets equally balanced for ME and lysine content. The
      coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility of nutrients in lactating sows
      were greater when using AIA compared to Cr2 O3 marker, regardless of dietary CP
      or NDF level, but their coefficients of variation were lower in the former than
      in the latter. In lactating sows, a trade-off between litter performance and
      nutrient digestion is established when reducing dietary CP or increasing NDF
      levels while maintaining similar lysine content through synthetic amino acids and
      balancing metabolizable energy through dietary fat sources.

TI  - Improving diets and nutrition through an integrated poultry value chain and
      nutrition intervention (SELEVER) in Burkina Faso: study protocol for a randomized
      trial.
PG  - 412
LID - 10.1186/s13063-017-2156-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SELEVER study is designed to evaluate the impact of an integrated
      agriculture-nutrition package of interventions (including poultry value chain
      development, women's empowerment activities, and a behavior change communications
      strategy to promote improved diets and feeding, care, and hygiene practices) on
      the diets, health, and nutritional status of women and children in Burkina Faso. 
      This paper presents the rationale and study design. METHODS: The impact
      evaluation involves a cluster randomized controlled trial design that will be
      implemented in 120 rural communities/villages within 60 communes supported by
      SELEVER in the Boucle de Mouhoun, Centre-Ouest, and Haut-Bassins regions of
      Burkina Faso. Communities will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment
      arms, including: (1) SELEVER intervention group; (2) SELEVER with an intensive
      WASH component; and (3) control group without intervention. Primary outcomes
      include the mean probability of adequacy of diets for women and children (aged
      2-4 years at baseline), infant and young child feeding practices of caregivers of
      children aged 0-2 years, and household poultry production and sales. Intermediate
      outcomes along the agriculture and nutrition pathways will also be measured,
      including child nutrition status and development. The evaluation will follow a
      mixed-methods approach, including a panel of child-, household-, community-, and 
      market-level surveys, and data collection points during post-harvest and lean
      seasons, as well as one year after implementation completion to examine
      sustainability. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to
      rigorously examine from a food systems perspective, the simultaneous impact of
      scaling-up nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions through a
      livestock value-chain and community-intervention platform, across nutrition,
      health, and agriculture domains. The findings of this evaluation will provide
      evidence to support the design of market-based nutrition-sensitive interventions.

AB  - Descriptive social-normative messaging positively influences short-term dietary
      choices and healthy food intake. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      effects of descriptive normative messages on college students' skin carotenoid
      concentrations (a biomarker of carotenoid-containing fruit and vegetable [FV]
      intake) over an 8-week period. 251 college students consented to participate and 
      74% completed the study. Students were randomly assigned to groups who, following
      a baseline evaluation of skin-carotenoid levels, were told how their score ranked
      within a peer group of college students attending the same university
      (Individualized Normative group), that their score was in the lower 20th
      percentile of the peer group (Manipulated Normative group), or were given no
      information about their score or the peer group (Control group). Skin carotenoid 
      concentrations were reassessed 8 weeks after the normative messages were
      presented or withheld. Skin carotenoid levels of those in the Manipulated
      Normative group increased significantly more than did scores of those in the
      Control group (t (126) = 3.74, p < 0.001; d = 0.67), but these students'
      self-reported FV intake did not increase. This finding suggests normative
      messaging can influence behavior for up to 8 weeks, but future research must
      better evaluate if the increase in skin carotenoids reflects increased FV
      consumption, increased consumption of carotenoid-containing FV (with decreased
      consumption of other FV), or is accounted for by some other behavior change
      (e.g., increased use of supplements). These findings support further exploration 
      of normative messaging as a technique for producing the long-term behavior change
      needed to impact public health.

AB  - Diarrhea is common in shelter dogs and nonspecific therapies like therapeutic
      diets, probiotics, and drugs with activity against Giardia spp. or enteric
      bacteria are commonly prescribed empirically. All dogs in this study were
      administered metronidazole, fed a standardized diet, and randomized to either
      receive a commercially available probiotic (Purina((R)) Pro Plan((R)) Veterinary 
      Diets; FortiFlora((R)) Probiotic Supplement, FortiFlora, Nestle Purina PetCare,
      St Louis, MO) or a placebo which was the commercial product without the probiotic
      for 7 days. A fecal score was assigned to each stool passed during the study by
      masked individuals. Fecal samples were evaluated for select enteric agents
      including nematodes, Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Clostridium
      perfringens enterotoxin before and at the end of the treatment period. There were
      no differences between groups in regard to parasite prevalence. By day 7, a
      normal stool (<5) was detected in 37.5% of the dogs administered metronidazole
      and 68.8% of the dogs administered dual therapy, but the result was not
      significant (P = .1556). The percentages of days with normal stools were
      significantly higher (P = .0496) for dogs administered dual therapy 65.6%) when
      compared to those administered metronidazole alone (46.9%). Giardia cysts were
      eliminated and diarrhea resolved in both dogs that were infected in the SF68
      group. In contrast, of the 7 Giardia positive dogs in the placebo group, 6
      (85.7%) were still positive for Giardia cysts on day 7, and 4 of those dogs still
      had diarrhea on day 7. Addition of SF68 to this protocol of metronidazole and a
      standardized diet appeared to enhance clinical responses in shelter dogs with
      diarrhea.

AB  - Vaccination of cattle against bovine tuberculosis could be a valuable control
      strategy, particularly in countries faced with intractable ongoing infection from
      a disease reservoir in wildlife. A field vaccination trial was undertaken in New 
      Zealand. The trial included 1286 effectively free-ranging cattle stocked at low
      densities in a remote 7600ha area, with 55% of them vaccinated using
      Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Danish strain 1311). Vaccine was administered orally in 
      all but 34 cases (where it was injected). After inclusion, cattle were exposed to
      natural sources of M. bovis infection in cattle and wildlife, most notably the
      brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Cattle were slaughtered at 3-5 years of
      age and were inspected for tuberculous lesions, with mycobacteriological culture 
      of key tissues from almost all animals. The prevalence of M. bovis infection was 
      4.8% among oral BCG vaccinates, significantly lower than the 11.9% in
      non-vaccinates. Vaccination appeared to both reduce the incidence of detectable
      infection, and to slow disease progression. Based on apparent annual incidence,
      the protective efficacy of oral BCG vaccine was 67.4% for preventing infection,
      and was higher in cattle slaughtered soon after vaccination. Skin-test reactivity
      to tuberculin was high in vaccinates re-tested 70days after vaccination but not
      in non-vaccinates, although reactor animals had minimal response in
      gamma-interferon blood tests. In re- tests conducted more than 12 months after
      vaccination, skin-test reactivity among vaccinates was much lower. These results 
      indicate that oral BCG vaccination could be an effective tool for greatly
      reducing detectable infection in cattle.

TI  - Making a balanced plate for pregnant women to improve birthweight of infants: a
      study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial in rural Bangladesh.
PG  - e015393
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015393 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low birthweight significantly contributes to neonatal mortality,
      morbidities and psychosocial debilities throughout the course of life. A large
      proportion of infants (36-55%) in Bangladesh is born with low birthweight.
      Nutritional status of women during pregnancy is critical for optimal growth and
      development of the fetus. Nutrition education has been found to improve maternal 
      nutritional status. Our study aims to determine whether nutrition education with 
      a practical demonstration during pregnancy is an effective intervention for
      improving the birthweight of infants compared with standard nutrition education
      only. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a community-based cluster randomised 
      controlled trial in one rural district of Bangladesh. Treatments will be
      allocated evenly between the study clusters (n=36). Participants in the
      intervention clusters receive 'balanced plate nutrition education' with a
      practical demonstration from community health workers 4-7 times throughout their 
      entire pregnancy, starting from the first trimester. The control clusters will
      receive standard nutrition education delivered by public and other healthcare
      providers as per ongoing antenatal care protocol. Our sample size would be 900
      pregnant women to determine 100 g differences in mean birthweight, considering 5%
      type 1 error, 80% power and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.03. The
      primary outcome of the trial is birthweight of the infants and the secondary
      outcomes include daily caloric intake and dietary diversity score among the
      pregnant women. Outcomes will be measured at enrolment, third to ninth month of
      gestation (monthly) and at delivery. Community health workers blinded to the
      study hypothesis will collect all data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was
      approved by the James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University Ethical
      Review Committee, Dhaka, Bangladesh. We will communicate the final results to
      relevant research and public health groups and publish research papers in
      peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12616000080426.

TI  - A Diagnostic Post-Occupancy Evaluation of the Nacadia(R) Therapy Garden.
LID - E882 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14080882 [doi]
AB  - The design of the Nacadia(R) therapy garden is based on a model for
      evidence-based health design in landscape architecture (EBHDL). One element of
      the model is a diagnostic post-occupancy evaluation (DPOE), which has not
      previously been fully developed. The present study develops a generic DPOE for
      therapy gardens, with a focus on studying the effects of the design on patients' 
      health outcomes. This is done in order to identify successes and failures in the 
      design. By means of a triangulation approach, the DPOE employs a mixture of
      methods, and data is interpreted corroborating. The aim of the present study is
      to apply the DPOE to the Nacadia(R) therapy garden. The results of the DPOE
      suggest that the design of the Nacadia(R) therapy garden fulfills its stated aims
      and objectives. The overall environment of the Nacadia (R) therapy garden was
      experienced as protective and safe, and successfully incorporated the various
      elements of the nature-based therapy programme. The participants encountered
      meaningful spaces and activities which suited their current physical and mental
      capabilities, and the health outcome measured by EQ-VAS (self-estimated general
      health) indicated a significant increase. Some design failures were identified,
      of which visual exposure was the most noteworthy. The DPOE model presented
      appears to be efficient but would nonetheless profit from being validated by
      other cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The usefulness of low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) for Japanese
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been fully investigated.
      Therefore, we compared the effectiveness and safety of LCD with calorie
      restricted diet (CRD). METHODS: This prospective, randomized, open-label,
      comparative study included 66 T2DM patients with HbA1c >7.5% even after receiving
      repeated education programs on CRD. They were randomly allocated to either the
      130g/day LCD group (n = 33) or CRD group (n = 33). Patients received personal
      nutrition education of CRD or LCD for 30 min at baseline, 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. 
      Patients of the CRD group were advised to maintain the intake of calories and
      balance of macronutrients (28x ideal body weight calories per day). Patients of
      the LCD group were advised to maintain the intake of 130 g/day carbohydrate
      without other specific restrictions. Several parameters were assessed at baseline
      and 6 months after each intervention. The primary endpoint was a change in HbA1c 
      level from baseline to the end of the study. RESULTS: At baseline, BMI and HbA1c 
      were 26.5 (24.6-30.1) and 8.3 (8.0-9.3), and 26.7 (25.0-30.0) kg/m(2) and 8.0
      (7.6-8.9) %, in the CRD and LCD, respectively. At the end of the study, HbA1c
      decreased by -0.65 (-1.53 to -0.10) % in the LCD group, compared with 0.00 (-0.68
      to 0.40) % in the CRD group (p < 0.01). Also, the decrease in BMI in the LCD
      group [-0.58 (-1.51 to -0.16) kg/m(2)] exceeded that observed in the CRD group (p
      = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that 6-month 130 g/day LCD reduced
      HbA1c and BMI in poorly controlled Japanese patients with T2DM. LCD is a
      potentially useful nutrition therapy for Japanese patients who cannot adhere to
      CRD. This trial was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/english/ (University
      Hospital Medical Information Network: study ID number 000010663).

AB  - Optimal feeding frequency was investigated to improve head-started propagation
      programme of juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas). The 15-day-old turtles
      (25-26 g body weight) were fed for ad libitum intake at one (1MD), two (2MD),
      three (3MD) or four (4MD) meals daily over a 3-month trial. Responses in growth, 
      feed utilization, faecal characteristics, haematological parameters and carapace 
      elemental composition were used to compare treatment effects. At the end of the
      feeding trial, no treatment had induced mortality. Growth performance in terms of
      weight gain and specific growth rate was similar in turtles fed 2MD, 3MD or 4MD
      (p > 0.05), but 1MD differed from these (p < 0.05), and feeding at excess
      frequency (3MD and 4MD) increased the within-group size variation. Turtles fed
      2MD had significantly lower feed intake than in 3MD and 4MD groups, but the feed 
      conversion ratios were similar. Faecal digestive enzyme analysis indicated higher
      catabolism of lipid and protein in the deprivation group (1MD), when compared
      with turtles fed at least twice daily. The feeding frequency did not affect the
      specific activities of carbohydrate-digesting enzymes. The results on enzymes
      activities were corroborated by the transition enthalpy characteristics of
      faeces, indicating nutrients remaining after digestion. The 2MD treatment also
      improved the haematological characteristics and the carapace quality, relative to
      low or excess feeding. Overall, the findings indicate that feeding juvenile green
      turtles twice a day is the preferred option in their head-started propagation.
      This promotes growth, reduces feed consumption, and improves health and carapace 
      quality.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate Ovopel and carp pituitary extract
      (CPE) in the reproductive induction of Colossoma macropomum males. Nine
      treatments were tested in triplicate, totaling 27 experimental units. C.
      macropomum breeders were subjected to the following treatments: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
      0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 Ovopel pellet/kg; 2.5 mg CPE/kg (traditional protocol);
      and a control treatment (no hormone). Breeders under hormone treatment produced a
      larger (P < 0.05) semen volume (2.4 +/- 0.7 to 4.2 +/- 0.3 mL) compared with the 
      control (0.9 +/- 0.4 mL). Sperm concentration did not differ significantly among 
      treatments (7.2 x 10(9) +/- 1.7 to 10.8 x 10(9) +/- 2.6 spermatozoa/mL). Total
      sperm count was higher (P < 0.05) after treatment with 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 Ovopel
      pellet/kg (41.6 +/- 9.3 to 42.3 +/- 10.5 x 10(9) spermatozoa) than the other
      Ovopel treatments (20.0 +/- 2.4 to 26.9 +/- 8.2 x 10(9) spermatozoa) and control 
      (6.6 +/- 1.1 x 10(9) spermatozoa), but did not differ significantly from CPE
      (33.7 +/- 3.2 x 10(9) spermatozoa). Sperm motility was higher (P < 0.05) in the
      CPE treated, and 0.2, 0.3, and 0.7 Ovopel pellet/kg (88.3 +/- 2.9 to 90.0 +/-
      5.0) breeders when compared with the other treatments (70.0 +/- 10.0 to 78.3 +/- 
      5.8), except for the 0.4 pellet/kg (81.7 +/- 2.9) treatment, which did not differ
      significantly from any of the treatments. The motility period of the spermatozoa 
      did not differ significantly among treatments (93.5 +/- 15.7 to 120.0 +/- 7.6 s).
      For the sperm morphological analysis, occurrence of normal spermatozoa was
      similar across the treatments, with three sperm abnormalities (short tail, bent
      tail, and detached head) differing (P < 0.05) among the treatments. Ovopel
      efficiently induced reproduction of C. macropomum breeders, with treatment using 
      0.3 and 0.4 Ovopel pellet/kg and CPE providing the best semen characteristics.

AB  - This study evaluated effects of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) on fertility 
      of 679 crossbred (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) lactating grazing cows synchronized
      for fixed-time AI (FTAI). At a random day of the estrous cycle cows received an
      intravaginal progesterone (P4) implant, 2 mg estradiol benzoate (EB) and 100 mug 
      gonadorelin (D0-AM). On D7-AM, cows received 0.5 mg sodium cloprostenol and were 
      randomly assigned into two treatments: eCG (n = 340; 400 IU eCG on D7), or
      Control (n = 339; no eCG). On D8-PM, P4 implants were removed and cows received
      0.5 mg sodium cloprostenol and 1 mg EB. Insemination was performed on D10-AM.
      Pregnancy was diagnosed 30 and 60 d after AI. Treatment with eCG tended to
      increase pregnancy per AI (P/AI) compared to Control at 30 (37.8 vs. 30.2%; P =
      0.06) and 60 (31.9 vs. 25.1%; P = 0.08) d. Pregnancy loss and twinning did not
      differ between groups. Treatment with eCG increased (P < 0.05) P/AI at 30 (39.0
      vs. 25.2%) and 60 (32.8 vs. 21.3%) d for cows inseminated at </= 70 d in milk
      (DIM) but had no effect in cows receiving AI after 70 DIM. Thus, eCG on D7 of a
      FTAI protocol increased fertility of crossbred dairy cows inseminated in the
      early postpartum period.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of an algorithm targeting antimicrobial therapy
      of diarrhoeic calves on the incidence of diarrhoea, antimicrobial treatment
      rates, overall mortality, mortality of diarrhoeic calves and changes in the
      faecal microbiota. The algorithm was designed to target antimicrobial therapy in 
      systemically ill calves from on two dairy farms. Retrospective (farm 1: 529
      calves; farm 2: 639 calves) and prospective (farm 1: 639 calves; farm 2: 842
      calves) cohorts were examined for 12 months before and after implementation of
      the algorithm. The Mantel-Haenszel test and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
      used to assess the cumulative incidence risk (CIR) and time to development of
      each outcome before and after implementation of the algorithm. The CIR of
      antimicrobial treatment rates was 80% lower after implementation of the algorithm
      on both farms (CIR 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.21). There was no
      difference in the CIR of overall mortality, but the CRI for mortality of
      diarrhoeic calves was lower in the period after implementation of the algorithm
      on one farm. The faecal microbiota of 15 healthy calves from both farms at each
      time period were characterised using a sequencing platform targeting the V4
      region of the 16S rRNA gene. On both farms, there were significant differences in
      community membership and structure (parsimony P<0.001). Use of the algorithm for 
      treatment of diarrhoeic calves reduced antimicrobial treatment rates without a
      negative impact on the health of calves. However, the experimental design did not
      take into account the potential confounding effects of dietary changes between
      the study periods.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of starter
      supplementation with fat sources differing in their fatty acid (FA) profile on
      performance of dairy calves during cold season. Sixty Holstein calves (3 d of
      age; 39.7 +/- 3.8 kg of body weight) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 starter
      diets supplemented with (1) no fat or oil source (control), (2) 3% palm fat
      (PLF), (3) 3% soybean oil (SBO), (4) 3% tallow (TAL), and (5) a 3.2% mixture
      (MIX) of PLF, SBO, and fish oil. The fat supplements were substituted for corn in
      the basal starter diet. Both the control and fat-supplemented diets contained
      similar amounts of dietary crude protein (19.4%), but the latter had a slightly
      higher quantity of calculated metabolizable energy (3.17 vs. 3.07 Mcal/kg) than
      did the former. Calves were reared outdoor in individual pens during the cold of 
      winter with a mean ambient temperature of 5.0 degrees C during the study period. 
      Whole milk was offered twice daily from d 3 to 45 and once from d 46 to 49. The
      animals were weaned on d 50 and monitored in their individual pens until d 70.
      Supplementation with SBO and MIX increased both the dietary concentration and
      ratio of essential FA (n-6 and n-3), whereas supplementation with TAL and PLF
      made no change in the essential FA profile. Starter intake and average daily gain
      were not affected by PLF and TAL supplements, but were reduced as a result of
      feeding MIX. Feeding supplemental SBO did not affect starter intake, but tended
      to improve average daily gain and final body weight. Fat sources had no effects
      on body skeletal measurements, fecal score, digestibility, ruminal pH, ammonia,
      and total volatile FA concentrations; however, feeding MIX increased rumen molar 
      proportion of propionate. No differences were observed in blood metabolites
      across the treatments during the preweaning period. Plasma concentrations of
      triacylglycerol and cholesterol increased when fat sources were supplemented and 
      glucose concentration increased when SBO was supplemented during the postweaning 
      period. Overall, addition of 3% PLF or TAL to the diet of young calves failed to 
      improve growth performance. Although addition of SBO and MIX increased the
      dietary essential FA concentration, calf performance was only improved when SBO
      was supplemented.

AB  - This study evaluated subsequent effects of glycerin on productive performance,
      egg quality, and hatching traits in Japanese quail. A total of 200 birds was
      arranged according to a completely randomized design into 5 treatment groups
      having 5 replicates of 8 birds each (6 females and 2 males). Treatments consisted
      5 levels of glycerin, i.e., 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10% and the control group. Birds
      were fed with different levels of glycerin during a rearing period of 6 wk and
      their subsequent effects on productive performance, egg quality, and hatching
      traits were observed. Data were collected regarding productive performance for 16
      wk; however, egg quality and hatching traits were recorded during pre-peak (at
      fourth wk), peak (at 12th wk), and post peak (at 16th wk) phase. Productive
      performance, egg quality, and hatching traits did not differ significantly
      throughout the experimental period. It was concluded that glycerin can be used as
      a replacement energy source, having no effect on productive and reproductive
      performance in Japanese quail.

TI  - Improving child nutrition and development through community-based childcare
      centres in Malawi - The NEEP-IE study: study protocol for a randomised controlled
      trial.
PG  - 284
LID - 10.1186/s13063-017-2003-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Nutrition Embedded Evaluation Programme Impact Evaluation
      (NEEP-IE) study is a cluster randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the
      impact of a childcare centre-based integrated nutritional and agricultural
      intervention on the diets, nutrition and development of young children in Malawi.
      The intervention includes activities to improve nutritious food production and
      training/behaviour-change communication to improve food intake, care and hygiene 
      practices. This paper presents the rationale and study design for this randomised
      control trial. METHODS: Sixty community-based childcare centres (CBCCs) in rural 
      communities around Zomba district, Malawi, were randomised to either (1) a
      control group where children were attending CBCCs supported by Save the
      Children's Early Childhood Health and Development (ECD) programme, or (2) an
      intervention group where nutritional and agricultural support activities were
      provided alongside the routine provision of the Save the Children's ECD
      programme. Primary outcomes at child level include dietary intake (measured
      through 24-h recall), whilst secondary outcomes include child development (Malawi
      Development Assessment Tool (MDAT)) and nutritional status (anthropometric
      measurements). At household level, primary outcomes include smallholder farmer
      production output and crop-mix (recall of last production season). Intermediate
      outcomes along theorised agricultural and nutritional pathways were measured.
      During this trial, we will follow a mixed-methods approach and undertake child-, 
      household-, CBCC- and market-level surveys and assessments as well as in-depth
      interviews and focus group discussions with project stakeholders. DISCUSSION:
      Assessing the simultaneous impact of preschool meals on diets, nutrition, child
      development and agriculture is a complex undertaking. This study is the first to 
      explicitly examine, from a food systems perspective, the impact of a preschool
      meals programme on dietary choices, alongside outcomes in the nutritional, child 
      development and agricultural domains. The findings of this evaluation will
      provide evidence to support policymakers in the scale-up of national programmes.

TI  - Experimentally induced subclinical mastitis: are lipopolysaccharide and
      lipoteichoic acid eliciting similar pain responses?
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s13028-017-0306-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain accompanying mastitis has gained attention recently as a
      relevant welfare compromising aspect of disease. Adequate pain recognition and
      therapy are necessary in the context of a modern and ethically acceptable dairy
      care. For research purposes mastitis is often induced by intramammary infusion of
      immunogenic bacterial cell wall components. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from
      Escherichia coli and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus are
      commonly administered to this end. While the immune response to specific
      immunogenic components has been well characterized, not much is known about their
      role on the expression of pain indicators. The aim of this study was to trial the
      effects of an intramammary challenge of LTA or LPS on the degree of pain and
      discomfort as indicated by both physiological and behavioral variables in cows.
      The hypothesis was that a similar degree of pain can be identified in LTA as well
      as in LPS induced mastitis. RESULTS: On the challenge day, compared to
      pre-challenge, total pain index increased for all treatment groups (LPS; LTA and 
      control), the LPS group having significantly higher values than the control group
      (P = 0.01). Similarly, pain visual analogue scale (VAS) increased significantly
      in all cows following treatment on the challenge day. Furthermore, compared to
      baseline, higher VAS were found 3, 4 and 5 h after the challenge in cows of the
      LPS group (P3h, 4h < 0.001 and P5h = 0.001) and 7 h after the challenge in cows
      of the LTA group (P7h = 0.002). In the control group, VAS was higher 5 h after
      the challenge (P5h = 0.001). On the challenge day, udder edema was higher in the 
      LPS than in the control group (P = 0.007). Furthermore, 4 h after the challenge, 
      milk cortisol was significantly higher than at baseline in the LPS group (P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When administered at equipotent doses targeting a standard
      somatic cell count increase, intramammary LPS seems to be accompanied by a higher
      degree of pain and discomfort than LTA, as suggested by the modifications of the 
      outcome variables total pain index, VAS, udder edema and milk cortisol.

TI  - Effects of different salinities on growth performance, survival, digestive enzyme
      activity, immune response, and muscle fatty acid composition in juvenile American
      shad (Alosa sapidissima).
PG  - 761-773
LID - 10.1007/s10695-016-0330-3 [doi]
AB  - The effects of salinity on survival, growth, special activity of digestive
      enzymes, nonspecific immune response, and muscle fatty acid composition were
      evaluated in the American shad (Alosa sapidissima). Juveniles of 35 days after
      hatching were reared at 0 (control), 7, 14, 21, and 28 ppt for 60 days. At the
      end of the experiment, juvenile American shad presented higher survival and
      specific growth rate (SGR) in salinity group (7, 14, and 21 ppt) than control
      group (P < 0.05). The special activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin was highest in
      fish reared at 21 ppt, while the highest lipase special activity was obtained in 
      control group (P < 0.05). The special activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
      lysozyme (LZM), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) showed significant
      increases in salinity group (14 and 21 ppt) compared to control group (P < 0.05).
      Lower muscle ash contents were detected in salinity group (14, 21, and 28 ppt)
      than control group (P < 0.05), while the contents of crude lipid and crude
      protein were significantly higher than control group (P < 0.05). The level of
      monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) exhibited a decreasing trend, while an
      increased level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was detected with the
      increase of salinity. Among the PUFA, the content of n-3 fatty acids in muscle
      tissue was found to be increasing with the increasing salinity, especially
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Results indicate that
      appropriate increase in salinity was reasonable and beneficial for juvenile
      American shad culture after a comprehensive consideration, especially salinity
      range from 14 to 21 ppt.

TI  - High dietary biotin levels affect the footpad and hock health of broiler chickens
      reared at different stocking densities and litter conditions.

AB  - Responses to stocking density (SD), dietary biotin concentration and litter
      condition were evaluated on 2016 Ross 308 male broilers in the fattening period
      (day 22-day 42). The birds were placed in 48 pens with either dry or wet litter
      to simulate the final stocking density of 30 kg (12 broilers/m(2) ; normal
      stocking density, NSD) and 40 kg (16 broilers/m(2) ; high stocking density, HSD) 
      of body weight (BW)/m(2) floor space. A corn-soybean meal-based diet was
      supplemented with biotin to provide a normal (NB; 155 mug/kg) or high (HB, 1521
      mug/kg) level of dietary biotin. There were six repetitions per treatment. The
      inappropriate moisture content of litter associated with HSD was avoided (p <
      0.05) by good management (SD difference: dry litter, 6.65% vs. wet litter,
      13.23%; 42 days), which made it advantageous (p < 0.01) for footpad (SD
      difference: dry litter, 0.118 vs. wet litter, 0.312; weekly average value) and
      hock health (SD difference: dry litter, 0.090 vs. wet litter, 0.303; weekly
      average value) of HSD birds, but not (p > 0.05) for growth and processing yield. 
      In HSD, the biotin effect (gains, FCR) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than
      in NSD. The similar response of HSD birds to supplemental biotin was observed (p 
      < 0.05) for lesion scores of footpad and hock in particularly finishing chickens,
      and a significant interaction (p < 0.01) among stocking density, biotin
      supplementation and litter condition existed from 35 to 42 days of age. Taken
      together, increasing dietary biotin improves the performance and well-being of
      broiler chickens stocked at high densities in litter-independent and
      litter-dependent manners respectively.

TI  - Short- and longer-term effects of feeding increased metabolizable protein with or

AB  - The first few weeks after parturition is marked by low, but increasing feed
      intake and sharply increasing milk production by dairy cows. Because of low
      intake, the nutrient density of the diet may need to be higher during this period
      to support increasing milk yields. We hypothesized that feeding higher levels of 
      metabolizable protein (MP) or a protein supplement with rumen-protected lysine
      and methionine during the immediate postpartum period would increase yields of
      milk and milk components. Fifty-six Holstein cows (21 primiparous and 35
      multiparous) starting at 3 d in milk were used in a randomized block design. In
      phase 1 (3 through 23 d in milk), cows were fed 1 of 3 diets that differed in
      supply of MP and AA profile. At 23 d in milk, all cows were moved to a common
      freestall pen and fed the control diet used in phase 1 for an additional 63 d
      (phase 2). Diets were formulated using the National Research Council model and
      were control [16.5% crude protein (CP), 10.9% rumen-degradable protein (RDP), and
      5.6% rumen-undegradable protein (RUP)], high MP (HMP; 18.5% CP, 11.6% RDP, 6.9%
      RUP), and AA (MPAA; 17.5% CP, 10.5% RDP, 7.0% RUP 29.7). The MPAA diet included a
      proprietary spray-dried blood meal product (Perdue Agribusiness, Salisbury, MD)
      and contained a model-estimated 7.2 and 2.6% of digestible lysine and methionine 
      (% of MP). The HMP and control diets contained 6.3 and 6.7% digestible lysine and
      both had 1.8% digestible methionine. In phase 1, diet did not affect milk yield
      (33.6, 34.7, and 33.2 kg for control, HMP, and MPAA, respectively), dry matter
      intake (17.8, 18.0, and 18.5 kg/d for control, HMP, and MPAA), or milk protein
      yield (1.07 kg/d). Feeding additional protein (HMP or MPAA) increased both the
      concentration and yield of milk fat, and milk protein concentration was greater
      (3.30 vs. 3.17%) for MPAA compared with the HMP diet. Energy-corrected milk was
      greater (38.4 and 38.6 vs. 35.3 kg/d, respectively) for MPAA and HP than for the 
      control. Cows fed MPAA had the greatest plasma concentrations of Met and the
      lowest concentrations of isoleucine, but lysine was not affected by treatment.
      Feeding additional MP (HMP or MPAA) reduced the concentrations of
      3-methylhistidine in plasma, indicating reduced muscle breakdown. Diet effects on
      milk composition continued after cows were changed to a common diet in that cows 
      fed MPAA the first 3 wk of lactation had greater concentration of milk protein
      for the entire experiment than cows fed HMP, and cows fed additional MP (HMP and 
      MPAA) during phase 1 had greater concentrations of milk fat for the entire
      experiment. Increasing dietary protein and AA supply in early lactation had
      short-term effects on yield of energy-corrected milk and long-term effects on
      milk composition.

TI  - Manipulation of reproductive seasonality using melatonin implantation in
      Anglo-Nubian does treated with controlled internal drug release and equine
      chorionic gonadotropin during the nonbreeding season.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of hormonal treatments 
      on ovarian activity and reproductive performance in anestrous Anglo-Nubian does
      during the nonbreeding season (February to May). A total of 48 multiparous does
      were divided into 2 groups (24 lactating does and 24 dry does). In each group,
      animals were allocated randomly into 2 equal subgroups (12 does each). In the
      first subgroup, does received a single 18-mg melatonin implant for 42 d followed 
      by a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device for 19 d in conjunction with 
      500 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) i.m. on the day of CIDR device
      removal. The second subgroup received CIDR combined with eCG in parallel with the
      first subgroup. Melatonin implantation induced a luteotrophic effect, expressed
      as an increasing number of corpora lutea, increased serum progesterone
      concentration, and reduced estradiol concentration. Regardless of treatment, dry 
      does showed greater value of progesterone concentration. With the advancement of 
      day of treatment, number of total follicles, small follicles, and medium
      follicles tended to increase to the greatest values at the day of CIDR device
      insertion. Furthermore, at day of mating, the numbers of large follicles reached 
      the greatest value, which was associated with the lowest value of the number of
      corpora lutea. At day of mating, serum progesterone concentration achieved the
      lowest value, which increased until d 56 of pregnancy. The estradiol:progesterone
      ratio showed the opposite trend. The detrimental effect of reproductive
      seasonality, expressed as cessation of estrus behavior and fertile mating during 
      the nonbreeding season, was successfully alleviated by the CIDR-eCG protocol.
      Furthermore, melatonin implantation in conjunction with the CIDR-eCG protocol
      enhanced conception rate and fecundity at d 28 of pregnancy and prolificacy at d 
      56 of pregnancy compared with does that were not implanted. Interestingly, does
      that failed to conceive did not come to heat again. In conclusion, the beneficial
      effect of melatonin implantation in conjunction with the CIDR-eCG protocol on the
      luteotrophic effect was reflected in the increasing number of corpora lutea,
      increasing progesterone concentration, and decreasing estradiol concentration.
      Furthermore, conception rate, prolificacy, and fecundity were improved compared
      with does that were not implanted during the nonbreeding season.

AB  - We investigated effects of perinatal exposure to dust or formaldehyde and the
      moment of first feed intake after hatching on broiler chicken development during 
      the first week of life. Four environmental treatments were used from 468 until
      512h of incubation: control (CONT), heat treated dust (HTD), untreated dust (UTD)
      or formaldehyde disinfection (FORM). After hatching, all chickens were assigned
      to 1 of 2 feeding treatments: early feeding (EF; feed and water available in the 
      hatcher) or delayed feeding (DF). After 512h of incubation (day 0), chickens were
      reared until day 7 of age. In DF chickens, body weight (BW), yolk free body mass 
      (YFBM) and relative liver weight did not differ among environmental treatments at
      day 0. However, in EF chickens BW at day 0 was greater in HTD chickens than in
      UTD and FORM chickens. YFBM in EF chickens at day 0 was greater when chickens
      were exposed to HTD compared to the other environmental treatments. In EF
      chickens, relative liver weight was greater in HTD chickens than in FORM. In DF
      chickens, BW at day 0 was positively related with hatching time (HT). In EF
      chickens, YFBM was positively related to HT. Residual yolk weight at day 0 was
      positively related with HT, whereas relative liver weight and microbicidal
      capacity were negatively related with HT. This study demonstrated that
      formaldehyde and dust during the hatching phase affect broiler chicken
      development at pulling from the incubator, but not at day 7.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective was to investigate the effect of placing mats on
      concrete slatted floors on performance, behaviour, hoof condition, dirt scores,
      physiological and immunological variables of beef steers, and to compare
      responses with animals on out-wintering pads. Continental crossbred beef steers
      [n = 360; mean (+/-SD) initial live weight 539 kg (42.2)] were blocked by breed
      and live weight and randomly assigned to one of five treatments; (1) Concrete
      slats alone, (2) Mat 1 (Natural Rubber structure) (Durapak Rubber Products), (3) 
      Mat 2 (Natural rubber structure) (EasyFix), (4) Mat 3 (modified ethylene vinyl
      acetate (EVA) foam structure) and (5) Out-wintering pads (OWP's). RESULTS:
      Animals on the OWPs had a greater (P < 0.05) live weight gain (P < 0.05) compared
      with the slat and Mat 2 treatments: results for Mat 1 and Mat 3 were the same (P 
      > 0.05) as the other treatments. Animals on the OWPs had reduced lying percentage
      time compared with all the other treatments. Dry matter (DM) intake was greater
      for animals on the OWPs compared with all the other treatments. Carcass weight,
      kill out proportion, carcass fat score, carcass composition score, FCR and
      physiological responses were similar (P > 0.05) among treatments. No incidence of
      laminitis was observed among treatments. The number of hoof lesions was greater
      on all mat types (P < 0.05) compared with concrete slats and OWP treatments. Dirt
      scores were greater (P < 0.05) for animals on OWPs when measured on days 42, 84, 
      105, 126 and 150 compared with animals on slats. CONCLUSIONS: Under the
      conditions adopted for the present study, there was no evidence to suggest that
      animals housed on bare concrete slats were disadvantaged in respect of animal
      welfare compared with animals housed on other floor types. It is concluded that
      the welfare of steers was not adversely affected by slats compared with different
      mat types or OWPs.

TI  - Oesophageal lumen pH in yearling horses and effects of management and
      administration of omeprazole.
PG  - 389-394
LID - 10.1111/evj.12608 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In human subjects, arytenoid chondritis can be caused by chemical
      trauma of mucosa attributable to gastro-oesophageal reflux. Although a similar
      process may be involved in the aetiopathogenesis of arytenoid chondritis in
      horses, the oesophageal lumen pH in this species is poorly understood.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine if gastro-oesophageal reflux occurs in horses by
      characterising oesophageal lumen pH. STUDY DESIGN: Blinded, randomised,
      placebo-controlled, crossover, experimental study. METHODS: Luminal oesophageal
      pH in six yearling horses was recorded over four 24 h periods using an ambulatory
      pH recorder attached to a catheter with two electrodes (proximal and distal)
      inserted into the oesophagus. Recordings of pH were made during three management 
      protocols. Initially, horses grazed in a paddock (Protocol A). Horses were then
      moved to stables to simulate sale preparation of Thoroughbred yearlings, and were
      given either omeprazole (Protocol B) or placebo paste (Protocol C) orally once
      per day. Protocol A was repeated for each horse (after a 13 day washout period)
      between Protocols B and C. Summary statistics described pH range and frequency of
      pH changes. Associations with predictor variables were investigated using linear 
      mixed-effects models. Data are presented as the mean +/- s.d. RESULTS:
      Oesophageal lumen pH ranged from 4.90 to 9.70 (7.36 +/- 0.27 and 7.18 +/- 0.24
      for the proximal and distal electrodes, respectively) and varied frequently (1.2 
      +/- 0.9 changes/min and 0.8 +/- 0.8 changes/min for the proximal and distal
      electrodes, respectively). Oesophageal lumen pH was associated with time since
      concentrate feeding, activity and time of day, but not with treatment of
      omeprazole. MAIN LIMITATIONS: A small number of horses were used and measurement 
      periods were limited. CONCLUSIONS: Gastro-oesophageal reflux occurs in clinically
      normal yearling horses. Although omeprazole had no detectable effect, oesophageal
      lumen pH recorded during this study did not fall within the therapeutic range of 
      omeprazole.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic analysis of thymol, carvacrol and diallyl disulfide after
      intramammary and topical applications in healthy organic dairy cattle.
PG  - 740-749
LID - 10.1080/19440049.2017.1285056 [doi]
AB  - Mastitis is among the most costly concerns for dairy producers whether cattle are
      managed conventionally or organically. Unfortunately, there are no USFDA-approved
      mastitis treatments that allow dairy cows in the United States to maintain
      organic dairy status. We investigated the plasma pharmacokinetics of three
      organic mastitis products currently used by organic producers and organic dairy
      veterinarians. Those products include intramammary, topical and intravaginal
      preparations, each dosed at two levels. Additionally, tissue data were collected 
      for kidney, liver and fat in order to estimate a withholding time for each of the
      products. The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) and lower limit of detection
      (LOD) were 0.001 and 0.0005 microg ml(-1), respectively, in plasma and all
      tissues except fat for both thymol and carvacrol. Fat had an LOQ of 0.01 microg
      ml(-1) and an LOD of 0.005 microg ml(-1) for thymol and carvacrol. Diallyl
      disulfide had an LOQ of 0.005 microg ml(-1) and LOD of 0.001 microg ml(-1) in all
      tissues. For diallyl disulfide (garlic), no levels above 0.001 microg ml(-1) were
      measurable in plasma or tissues. For topical and intramammary products, levels
      were measurable in the plasma, liver, kidney and fat up to 72 h after the last
      dose. The plasma half-lives were short for thymol (approximately 1.6 h) and
      carvacrol (approximately 1.5 h), whereas the estimated half-lives for these
      substances in tissues ranged from 13.9 to 31.5 h for thymol and from 16.9 to 25 h
      for carvacrol. The predicted amount of time that the molecules would be found in 
      the body based on the slowest depletion time of liver tissue was 13 days for
      thymol and 10 days for carvacrol. The apparent half-life of topically applied
      carvacrol was approximately 4.5 h in plasma, with an estimated withhold time of
      10 days. These times were calculated using the USFDA's tolerance limit method for
      meat withdrawal times.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a nutrition education intervention included in
      the Home Care Program for caregivers to prevent the increasing risk of
      malnutrition of dependent patients at risk of malnutrition. DESIGN: Randomized
      controlled multicenter trial of 6 months of duration and 12 months follow-up.
      SETTINGS: 10 Primary Care Centers, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in the 
      Home Care Program between January 2010 and March 2012, who were dependent and at 
      risk of malnutrition, older than 65, and had caregivers (n=190). INTERVENTION:
      The nurses conducted initial educational intervention sessions for caregivers and
      then monitored at home every month for 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: The nutritional
      status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment test (primary outcome),
      diet, anthropometry, and biochemical parameters (albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin 
      and cholesterol). Other descriptive and outcome measures were recorded: current
      medical history, Activities of daily living (Barthel test), cognitive state
      (Pfeiffer test), and mood status (Yesavage test). All the measures were recorded 
      in a schedule of 0-6-12 months. RESULTS: 173 individuals participated after
      exclusions (intervention n=101; control n=72). Mean age was 87.8+/-8.9years,
      68.2% were women. Difference were found between the groups for Mini Nutritional
      Assessment test score change (repeated measures ANOVA, F=10.1; P<0.001), the
      intervention improved the Mini Nutritional Assessment test score of the
      participants in the intervention group. The egg consumption (F=4.1; P=0.018),
      protein intake (F=3.0; P=0.050), polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (F=5.3;
      P=0.006), folate (F=3.3; P=0.041) and vitamin E (F=6.4; P=0.002) showed
      significant groupxtime interactions. CONCLUSION: A nutrition education
      intervention for caregivers halted the tendency of nutritional decline, and
      reduced the risk of malnutrition of older dependent patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a selective antibiotic
      treatment strategy based on a quick bacteriological on-farm test (Petrifilm, 3M
      Corp., St. Paul, MN) compared with the conventional antibiotic treatment of all
      cows having clinical endometritis (CE) defined by the presence of purulent
      vaginal discharge on both clinical cure rate and reproductive performance. The
      study was simultaneously conducted with dairy cows reared under a highly
      supplemented rotational grazing system in Argentina and in a freestall system in 
      Slovakia. Cows having an abnormal vaginal discharge (VD, indicative of clinical
      endometritis) on 21 to 35 d in milk (DIM) were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 study
      groups: selective treatment (ST) or conventional treatment (CT). All cows in the 
      CT group (n = 174) received a single intrauterine administration of 500 mg of
      cephapirin. In the ST group (n = 178), treatment decision was made according to
      the results of the bacteriological on-farm test. For this test, we collected
      intrauterine samples with the cytobrush technique and stroke the brushes onto 2
      different Petrifilm plates, one for aerobic count and another for
      Enterobacteriaceae count, incubated the plates, and counted the number of
      colonies after 24 h. Positive cows (>/=5 colonies in one or both plates) received
      a single intrauterine treatment with 500 mg of cephapirin, whereas negative cows 
      (<5 colonies) remained untreated. Clinical cure rate was assessed by direct
      vaginal inspection at 14 d after treatment (VD-0). The odds for conception at
      first artificial insemination, artificial insemination by 80 DIM, pregnancy by
      100 DIM, and for nonpregnancy by 200 DIM were estimated with mixed logistic
      regression models. The hazard of conception was also assessed with proportional
      hazard regression model. The selective antibiotic treatment strategy based on the
      outcome of Petrifilm test reduced the number of required treatments (57%) and
      maintained similar efficacy in terms of clinical cure and reproductive
      performance as the conventional antibiotic treatment of all endometritic cows.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Shaping Healthy Choices Program
      (SHCP). DESIGN: A clustered, randomized, controlled intervention lasting 1 school
      year. SETTING: Schools in northern and central California. PARTICIPANTS:
      Fourth-graders (aged 9-10 years) at 2 control schools (n = 179) and 2
      intervention schools (n = 230). INTERVENTION: Garden-enhanced education, family, 
      and community partnerships; increased regionally procured produce in the
      lunchroom; and school-site wellness committees. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in
      body mass index (BMI) percentiles/Z-scores; nutrition knowledge, science process 
      skills, and vegetable identification and preferences; and reported fruit and
      vegetable intake. ANALYSIS: Student t test, chi-square, ANOVA of change, and
      multilevel regression mixed model to evaluate change in outcomes with school as a
      random effect to account for cluster design effects. Statistical significance was
      set at P < .05. RESULTS: There was a greater improvement in BMI percentile
      (-6.08; P < 0.01), BMI Z-score (-0.28; P < .001), and waist-to-height ratio
      (-0.02; P < .001) in the intervention compared with the control schools.
      CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The SHCP resulted in improvements in nutrition
      knowledge, vegetable identification, and a significant decrease in BMI
      percentiles. This supports the concept that the SHCP can be used to improve the
      health of upper elementary school students.

TI  - Nutrition education improves dietary diversity of children 6-23 months at
      community-level: Results from a cluster randomized controlled trial in Malawi.
PG  - e0175216
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0175216 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low dietary quality and quantity and inappropriate feeding practices 
      can cause undernutrition. Poor nutritional status in early childhood is
      associated with growth faltering. The objective of the study was to assess the
      potential of community-based nutrition education to improve height-for-age
      z-scores in children 6-23 months of age. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We carried out a
      cluster-randomized-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of nutrition
      education. A total of 24 Extension Planning Area Sections served as clusters. The
      selection criteria were: the position of the extension officer was staffed and
      the sections had been selected by the project for activities in its first project
      year. The sections were randomized into intervention and control restricted on
      mean height for age Z-score using baseline information. In the intervention area,
      food security activities and community-based nutrition education was implemented.
      The control area received food security activities only. At baseline (2011) and
      endline (2014), caregivers with a child below two years of age were enrolled.
      Data assessment included anthropometric measurements, interviews on
      socio-economic status, dietary intake and feeding practices. A
      difference-in-differences estimator was used to calculate intervention effects. A
      positive impact on child dietary diversity was observed (B (SE) = 0.39 (0.15), p 
      = 0.01; 95%CI 0.09-0.68). There was a non-significant positive intervention
      effect on mean height-for-age z-scores (B (SE) = 0.17 (0.12), p = 0.15; 95%CI
      -0.06-0.41). LIMITATIONS: The 24h dietary recalls used to measure dietary
      diversity did not consider quantities of consumed foods. Unrecorded poor quality 
      of consumed foods might have masked a potential benefit of increased child
      dietary diversity on growth. CONCLUSIONS: Participatory community-based nutrition
      education for caregivers improved child dietary diversity even in a food insecure
      area. Nutrition education should be part of programs in food insecure settings
      aiming at ameliorating food insecurity among communities.

AB  - Targeted-selective treatments against gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) in adult
      dairy cows require the identification of "cows to treat", i.e. cows whose milk
      production (MP) would increase after treatment. This study aimed at quantifying
      the ability of multi-indicator profiles to identify such cows. A randomized
      controlled clinical trial was conducted at housing in 25 French pasturing dairy
      herds. In each herd, treated cows received fenbendazole orally, control cows
      remained untreated. Daily MP was recorded and the MP variation between the pre-
      and post-visit periods was calculated (DeltaMP) for each cow. DeltaMP was
      modelled with control cows data (n=412) (piecewise linear mixed model). Estimated
      parameters were applied to treated cows data (n=414) to predict the expected
      DeltaMP in treated cows if they had not been treated. Treated cows with an
      observed DeltaMP (with treatment) higher than the expected DeltaMP (without
      treatment) were labelled as "cows to treat". Herds where at least 50% of the
      young cows were "cows to treat" were qualified as "herds to target". To
      characterize such cows and herds, the available candidate indicators were (i) at 
      the cow-level: parity, stage of lactation and production level, faecal egg count 
      (FEC), serum pepsinogen level and anti-Ostertagia antibody level (expressed as
      ODR); (ii) at the herd-level: bulk tank milk (BTM) Ostertagia ODR, Time of
      Effective Contact (TEC, in months) with GIN infective larvae before the first
      calving, and percentage of positive FEC. These indicators were tested one-by-one 
      or in combination to assess their ability to characterize "herds to target" and
      "cows to treat" (Chi-square tests). 115 out of 414 treated cows (27.8%) were
      considered as "cows to treat", and 9 out of 22 herds were qualified as "herds to 
      target". The indicators retained to profile such cows and herds were the parity, 
      the production level, the BTM Ostertagia ODR and the TEC. Multi-indicator
      profiles were much more specific than single indicator profiles, induced lower
      treatment rates, thereby minimizing the selection pressure on parasite
      populations. Particularly, to target a herd, the specificity was better with the 
      profile "high BTM Ostertagia ODR and low-TEC" than with the BTM ODR value taken
      into account alone. The targeted-selective treatment of "young cows, belonging to
      herds with a high BTM ODR at housing and a low TEC" appeared as a pertinent
      solution, enabling a global approach for the control of GIN infection in which
      GIN control in heifers is connected to GIN control in adult cows.

TI  - Farm Fresh Foods for Healthy Kids (F3HK): An innovative community supported
      agriculture intervention to prevent childhood obesity in low-income families and 
      strengthen local agricultural economies.
PG  - 306
LID - 10.1186/s12889-017-4202-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity persists in the United States and is associated
      with serious health problems. Higher rates of obesity among children from
      disadvantaged households may be, in part, attributable to disparities in access
      to healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. Community supported agriculture
      can improve access to and consumption of fresh produce, but the upfront payment
      structure, logistical barriers, and unfamiliarity with produce items may inhibit 
      participation by low-income families. The aim of this project is to assess the
      impact of subsidized, or "cost-offset," community supported agriculture
      participation coupled with tailored nutrition education for low-income families
      with children. METHODS/DESIGN: The Farm Fresh Foods for Healthy Kids
      community-based, randomized intervention trial will build on formative and
      longitudinal research to examine the impact of cost-offset community supported
      agriculture on diet and other health behaviors as well as the economic impacts on
      local economies. The intervention will involve reduced-price community supported 
      agriculture shares which can be paid for on a weekly basis, nine skill-based and 
      seasonally-tailored healthy eating classes, and the provision of basic kitchen
      tools. Low income families with at least one child aged 2-12 years will be
      recruited to join existing community supported agriculture programs in New York, 
      North Carolina, Vermont, and Washington. In each program, families will be
      randomized 1:1 to intervention or delayed intervention groups. Data will be
      collected at baseline, and in the fall and spring for 3 years. The primary
      outcomes are children's intake of fruits and vegetables and foods high in sugar
      and/or (solid) fat, as well as diet quality; secondary outcomes include physical,
      behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental variables. Cost-effectiveness and
      economic impact at the farm and community levels also will be assessed.
      DISCUSSION: This integrated project will provide important information and
      contribute to the evidence base regarding the use of local agricultural
      interventions to improve children's dietary behaviors and weight maintenance.
      Findings also will inform the development of a toolkit for farmers and education 
      modules related to local food system innovations for undergraduate and graduate
      students. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02770196 . Registered 5 April

TI  - Adult and adolescent livestock productive asset transfer programmes to improve
      mental health, economic stability and family and community relationships in rural
      South Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo: a protocol of a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - e013612
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013612 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: People living in poverty have limited access to traditional
      financial institutions. Microfinance programmes are designed to meet this gap and
      show promise in improving income, economic productivity and health. Our
      Congolese-US community academic research partnership developed two livestock
      productive asset transfer programmes, Pigs for Peace (PFP) and Rabbits for
      Resilience (RFR), to address the interlinked health, social and economic
      well-being of individuals, their families and communities. The community-based
      randomised controlled trials examine the effectiveness of PFP and RFR to improve 
      health, economic stability, and family and community relationships among male and
      female adults and adolescents living in 10 rural, postconflict villages of
      eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PFP participants
      include adult permanent residents of rural villages; adolescent participants in
      RFR include male and female adolescents 10-15 years old living in the selected
      rural villages. Participants were randomised to intervention or delayed control
      group. Participants in PFP completed baseline interview prior to intervention and
      follow-up interview at 6, 12 and 18 months postintervention. In RFR, participants
      completed baseline interview prior to intervention and follow-up interview at 6, 
      12 and 18 months postbaseline. The primary outcome of both trials, the change in 
      baseline mental health distress at 18 months in the intervention group (adults,
      adolescents) compared to control group, is used to calculate sample size. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: The Johns Hopkins Medical Institute Internal Review Board
      approved this protocol. A committee of respected Congolese educators and
      community members (due to lack of local ethics review board) approved the study. 
      The findings will provide important information on the potential for
      community-led sustainable development initiatives to build on traditional
      livelihood (livestock raising, agriculture) to have a sustained health, economic 
      and social impact on the individual, family and community. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Evaluating Changes in Omega-3 Fatty Acid Intake after Receiving Personal FADS1
      Genetic Information: A Randomized Nutrigenetic Intervention.
LID - E240 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu9030240 [doi]
AB  - Nutrigenetics research is anticipated to lay the foundation for personalized
      dietary recommendations; however, it remains unclear if providing individuals
      with their personal genetic information changes dietary behaviors. Our objective 
      was to evaluate if providing information for a common variant in the fatty acid
      desaturase 1 (FADS1) gene changed omega-3 fatty acid (FA) intake and blood levels
      in young female adults (18-25 years). Participants were randomized into Genetic
      (intervention) and Non-Genetic (control) groups, with measurements taken at
      Baseline and Final (12 weeks). Dietary intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was assessed using an omega-3 food frequency
      questionnaire. Red blood cell (RBC) FA content was quantified by gas
      chromatography. Implications of participation in a nutrigenetics study and
      awareness of omega-3 FAs were assessed with online questionnaires. Upon
      completion of the study, EPA and DHA intake increased significantly (p = 1.0 x
      10(-4)) in all participants. This change was reflected by small increases in RBC 
      %EPA. Participants in the Genetic group showed increased awareness of omega-3
      terminology by the end of the study, reported that the dietary recommendations
      were more useful, and rated cost as a barrier to omega-3 consumption less often
      than those in the Non-Genetic group. Providing participants FADS1 genetic
      information did not appear to influence omega-3 intake during the 12 weeks, but
      did change perceptions and behaviors related to omega-3 FAs in this timeframe.

TI  - A Potential Tool for Clinicians; Evaluating a Computer-Led Dietary Assessment
      Method in Overweight and Obese Women during Weight Loss.
LID - E218 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu9030218 [doi]
AB  - Many Americans are attempting to lose weight with the help of healthcare
      professionals. Clinicians can improve weight loss results by using technology.
      Accurate dietary assessment is crucial to effective weight loss. The aim of this 
      study was to validate a computer-led dietary assessment method in
      overweight/obese women. Known dietary intake was compared to Automated
      Self-Administered 24-h recall (ASA24) reported intake in women (n = 45), 19-50
      years, with body mass index of 27-39.9 kg/m(2). Participants received nutrition
      education and reduced body weight by 4%-10%. Participants completed one
      unannounced dietary recall and their responses were compared to actual intake.
      Accuracy of the recall and characteristics of respondent error were measured
      using linear and logistic regression. Energy was underreported by 5% with no
      difference for most nutrients except carbohydrates, vitamin B12, vitamin C,
      selenium, calcium and vitamin D (p = 0.002, p < 0.0001, p = 0.022, p = 0.010, p =
      0.008 and p = 0.001 respectively). Overall, ASA24 is a valid dietary assessment
      tool in overweight/obese women participating in a weight loss program. The
      automated features eliminate the need for clinicians to be trained, to
      administer, or to analyze dietary intake. Computer-led dietary assessment tools
      should be considered as part of clinician-supervised weight loss programs.

TI  - Partial or total replacement of commercial concentrate with on-farm-grown
      mulberry forage: effects on lamb growth and feeding costs.
PG  - 537-546
LID - 10.1007/s11250-017-1225-8 [doi]
AB  - Replacing commercial concentrate with mulberry foliage was evaluated in a feeding
      trial lasting 126 days. Forty-eight weaned male Pelibuey lambs (20.6 +/- 0.80 kg 
      of BW) were randomly allocated to four groups: (1) supplementing the basal diet
      with mulberry at 1% (DM basis; M-1), (2) mulberry at 0.75% plus 0.1 kg
      concentrate fresh matter basis (M-0.75), (3) mulberry at 0.50% plus 0.2 kg
      concentrate (M-0.50) and (4) basal diet plus 0.3 kg concentrate (control; M-0).
      During the first 90 days, the basal diet was Pennisetum purpureum forage which
      was substituted by a mixture of guinea grass and sugarcane from 90 days. Average 
      daily gain (ADG, g/day), dry matter intake (DMI) and feed conversion rate (FCR;
      DMI/ADG) were determined. The ADG was affected (P < 0.01) by the diet, with the
      lowest obtained in M-1 lambs (71 +/- 6.4 g/day), whereas no differences among the
      other groups were observed (94 +/- 6.4 g DM/lamb). The DMI was higher (P < 0.01) 
      in M-0 (937 g DM/lamb) which concomitantly affected differences in FCR (11.9,
      9.9, 10.5 and 9.7 kg DMI/kg BW gain for M-1, M-0.75, M-0.50 and M-0 lambs,
      respectively). Final BW at slaughtering and hot or cold carcass yields were
      coherent with growth rate findings. Biological yield (cold carcass weight/empty
      BW) was higher (P < 0.01) in M-0.75. Without compromising animal productivity,
      replacing imported concentrate with mulberry reduced the feeding cost. Optimum
      results were obtained with M-75 diet. Further studies must be conducted for
      optimizing energy/protein ratios with different ingredients while increasing DMI 
      and lamb growth rates in this tropical genotype.

TI  - Response of cattle with clinical osteochondrosis to mineral supplementation.
PG  - e1-e6
LID - 10.4102/ojvr.v84i1.1365 [doi]
AB  - Since 1982, farmers in the North West province and other parts of South Africa
      have noticed an increase in the incidence of lameness in cattle. Macro- and
      microscopical lesions of joints resembled osteochondrosis. Pre-trial data
      indicated that cattle with osteochondrotic lesions recovered almost completely
      when fed a supplement containing bio-available micro- and macrominerals of high
      quality. In the present trial, 43 clinically affected cattle of varying ages (1-5
      years) and sexes were randomly divided into three groups. Each group was fed the 
      same commercial supplement base with differing micro- and macromineral
      concentrations to determine the effect of mineral concentrations on the recovery 
      from osteochondrosis. Both supplements 1 and 2 contained 25% of the recommended
      National Research Council (NRC) mineral values. Additional phosphate was added to
      supplement 2. Supplement 3, containing 80% of the NRC mineral values, was used as
      the control. Results from all three groups indicated no recovery from
      osteochondrosis. Urine pH of a small sample of the test cattle showed aciduria
      (pH &lt; 6). Supplement analysis revealed addition of ammonium sulphate that
      contributed sulphate and nitrogen to the supplement. Supplementary dietary cation
      anion difference (DCAD) values were negative at -411 mEq/kg, -466 mEq/kg and -467
      mEq/kg for supplements 1, 2 and 3, respectively, whereas the pre-trial supplement
      was calculated at +19.87 mEq/kg. It was hypothesised that feeding a low
      (negative) DCAD diet will predispose growing cattle to the development of
      osteochondrosis or exacerbate subclinical or clinical osteochondrosis in cattle.

TI  - Mediterranean meal versus Western meal effects on postprandial ox-LDL, oxidative 
      and inflammatory gene expression in healthy subjects: a randomized controlled
      trial for nutrigenomic approach in cardiometabolic risk.
PG  - 141-149
LID - 10.1007/s00592-016-0917-2 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Inflammation and oxidative damage contribute significantly to the
      development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Postprandial oxidative stress and
      inflammation are characterized by an increased susceptibility of the organism
      toward oxidative damage after consumption of a meal rich in lipids and/or
      carbohydrates. Micronutrients modulate immune system and exert a protective
      action by reducing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) level. The aim of
      the present study was to evaluate the postprandial plasma ox-LDL level and the
      gene expression of 13 genes related to oxidative stress (HOSp) and human
      inflammasome pathways (HIp), after a tocopherol-enriched Mediterranean meal
      (TEM), and a Western high-fat meal (HFM). Moreover, Mediterranean Adequacy Index 
      was calculated to define the quality of both meals. METHODS: We set up a
      randomized and crossover trial in healthy human volunteers. Ox-LDL level was
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the gene expression of 13 genes
      related to HOSp and HIp by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Ox-LDL levels significantly
      decreased comparing HFM versus TEM (p < 0.05). Percentages of significantly
      overexpressed genes after each dietary treatment are as follows: (A) baseline
      versus HFM: 7.69 % HIp and 23.08 % HOSp; (B) baseline versus TEM: 7.69 % HIp and 
      7.69 % HOSp; (C) HFM versus TEM: 15.38 % HIp and 15.38 % HOSp. CONCLUSIONS: TEM
      reduced postprandial risk factors of CVD, such as ox-LDL, and the expression of
      inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes. Chronic studies on larger
      population are necessary before definitive conclusions. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov Id: NCT01890070.

AB  - Bacterial populations of teat skin are associated with risk of intramammary
      infection and may be influenced by anatomical characteristics of teats. The
      objective of this study was to evaluate associations of selected anatomical
      characteristics of teats with bacterial counts of teat skin of cows exposed to
      different types of bedding. Primarily primiparous Holstein cows (n = 128) were
      randomly allocated to 4 pens within a single barn. Each pen contained 1 type of
      bedding [new sand (NES), recycled sand (RS), deep-bedded manure solids (DBMS),
      and shallow-bedded manure solids over foam core mattresses (SBMS)]. During a
      single farm visit udders (n = 112) were scored for hygiene and 1 front (n = 112) 
      and 1 rear teat (n = 111) of each enrolled cow were scored for hyperkeratosis
      (HK). Teat length, teat barrel diameter, and teat apex diameter were measured and
      teat skin swabs were systematically collected for microbiological analysis.
      Linear type evaluation data for udders of each cow were retrieved for each cow.
      Teat position (front or rear) was associated with occurrence of clinical mastitis
      during the 12 mo before the farm visit and more cases occurred in front quarters.
      The proportion of udders that were classified as clean (score 1 or 2) was 68, 82,
      54, and 95% for cows housed in pens containing NES, RS, SBMS, and DBMS,
      respectively. No association was found between HK score and teat position and no 
      association was found between HK score and teat skin bacterial count. Bacterial
      counts of teat skin swabs from front teats of cows in pens containing RS and SBMS
      were significantly less than those of rear teats of cows in pens containing DBMS 
      or NES. Teat skin bacterial counts were significantly greater for swabs obtained 
      from teats of cows with udder hygiene scores of 3 and 4 as compared with swabs
      obtained from cows with cleaner udders. Of all udder conformation traits
      evaluated, only narrower rear teat placement was positively associated with
      bacterial counts on teat skin.

TI  - Amenorative effects of exogenous gonadotropins on reproductive profiles of
      replacement gilts with delayed puberty in a farm in Thailand.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - This study was to investigate the effect of gonadotropins on reproductive
      profiles of replacement gilts with delayed puberty. Totally, 136 Landrace X
      Yorkshire crossbred gilts, were categorized into control (n = 58) and treatment
      (n = 78) groups. Gonadotropins (400 U eCG plus 200 IU hCG) were administered in
      treatment group only. The results revealed that gilts in treatment group had
      higher number of gilts with estrus (92.3 vs 25.9%, P < 0.001), shorter onset to
      estrus (4.7 +/- 0.3 vs 9.0 +/- 0.8 d, P < 0.001), higher number of dominant
      follicles (18.0 +/- 0.2 vs 13.2 +/- 0.3 follicles, P < 0.001), and higher
      farrowing rate (87.5 vs 53.3%, P = 0.002) than those in control group. In
      conclusion, gonadotropins containing 400 IU eCG plus 200 IU hCG could improve
      reproductive profiles in replacement gilts with delayed puberty.

TI  - LA sprouts randomized controlled nutrition, cooking and gardening programme
      reduces obesity and metabolic risk in Hispanic/Latino youth.
PG  - 28-37
LID - 10.1111/ijpo.12102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many programmes for children that involve gardening and nutrition
      components exist; however, none include experimental designs allowing more
      rigorous evaluation of their impact on obesity. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this
      study is to explore the effects of a novel 12-week gardening, nutrition and
      cooking intervention {'LA Sprouts'} on dietary intake, obesity parameters and
      metabolic disease risk among low-income, primarily Hispanic/Latino youth in Los
      Angeles.. METHODS: This study used a randomized control trial involving four
      elementary schools [two randomized to intervention {172, 3rd-5th grade students};
      two randomized to control {147, 3rd-5th grade students}]. Classes were taught in 
      90-min sessions once per week for 12 weeks. Data collected at pre-intervention
      and post-intervention included dietary intake via food frequency questionnaire,
      anthropometric measures {body mass index, waist circumference}, body fat, and
      fasting blood samples. RESULTS: LA Sprouts participants compared with controls
      had significantly greater reductions in body mass index z-scores {-0.1 vs. -0.04,
      respectively; p = 0.01} and waist circumference {-1.2 vs. 0.1 cm; p < 0.001}.
      Fewer LA Sprouts participants had the metabolic syndrome after the intervention
      than before, while controls with metabolic syndrome increased. LA Sprouts
      participants compared with controls increased dietary fiber intake {+3.4% vs.
      -16.5%; p = 0.04}. All participants decreased vegetable intake, but decreases
      were less in LA Sprouts than controls {-3.7% vs. -26.1%; p = 0.04}. Change in
      fruit intake did not differ between LA Sprouts and controls. CONCLUSIONS: LA
      Sprouts was effective in reducing obesity and metabolic risk; however, additional
      larger and longer-term studies are warranted.

TI  - Evaluation of different litter materials for broiler production in a hot and

AB  - The availability of wood by-products for bedding material is falling in many
      regions due to rising demand for other uses. The objective of this study was to
      evaluate six alternative litter sources-river bed sand, coconut husk, rice hulls,
      Guinea grass, newspaper, and corncob-as a substitute for wood shavings (WS). The 
      trial was carried out over 35 days in an open-sided and naturally ventilated
      broiler house under conditions of high ambient temperatures and relative
      humidity. During the brooding period (0 to 14 days), chicks raised on grass had
      lower (P < 0.05) footpad temperature than those grown on WS. After the brooding
      period (15 to 35 days), the temperatures of both litter and birds were higher (P 
      < 0.05) for coconut husk than for WS. Grass litter resulted in lower (P < 0.05)
      final BW, FCR, and production efficiency. Sand and rice hulls were associated
      with lower (P < 0.05) survival rate and higher (P < 0.05) gizzard weight. Litter 
      type did not affect carcass and meat yields. The footpad dermatitis score,
      associating incidence and severity, was not statistically different among the
      litter substrates tested, although numerically higher in coconut husk, grass, and
      corncob. The results obtained in this experiment indicate that, in a hot and
      humid environment, all materials except grass can be used as a substitute for
      wood shavings with comparable production efficiency.

LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1198-z [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to determine the effect of estradiol benzoate (EB)
      on reproductive response following a controlled internal drug release (CIDR)
      protocol in crossbred (Sahiwal x Friesian) dairy heifers. In the first trial, a
      total of 100 crossbred dairy heifers were treated with CIDR protocol for 7 days
      and injected with the PGF2alpha on day 6. After 24 h of CIDR removal, one group
      (EB = 50) was injected with estradiol benzoate whereas the other (control = 50)
      remained untreated. Estrus intensity and response were recorded visually and
      ovulation rate was recorded by ultrasonography. All heifers were artificially
      inseminated at 48 and 60 h following CIDR removal. Heifers were scanned for
      pregnancy within days 30-40 of artificial insemination (AI). In the second trial,
      two subgroups of heifers were included to observe the estrus and ovulatory
      events. The results of the first trial revealed that estrus response was achieved
      100% in both the treatment groups. Estrus intensity (2.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.7)
      and ovulation rate (100 vs. 88%) differed significantly (P < 0.05) between the EB
      and control groups. However, a tendency for higher pregnancy per AI was observed 
      (54 vs. 36%; P = 0.07) in EB than that in control groups. The results of the
      second trial revealed that a significantly (P < 0.05) shorter estrus and earlier 
      ovulatory events were observed in EB-treated heifers. It is concluded that the
      incorporation of estradiol benzoate to the CIDR protocol is helpful to improve
      the estrus signs and enhance the ovulation and the pregnancy per AI in crossbred 
      dairy heifers.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess both independent and combined effects
      of routine foot trimming of heifers at 3 weeks pre-calving and 100 days post
      calving on the first lactation lameness and lactation productivity. A total of
      419 pre-calving dairy heifers were recruited from one heifer rearing operation
      over a 10-month period. Heifers were randomly allocated into one of four foot
      trimming regimens; pre-calving foot trim and post-calving lameness score (Group
      TL), pre-calving lameness score and post-calving foot trim (Group LT),
      pre-calving foot trim and post-calving foot trim (Group TT), and pre-calving
      lameness score and post-calving lameness score (Group LL, control group). All
      heifers were scored for lameness at 24 biweekly time points for 1 year following 
      calving, and first lactation milk production data were collected. Following
      calving, 172/419 (41.1%) of heifers became lame during the study (period
      prevalence), with lameness prevalence at each time-point following calving
      ranging from 48/392 (12.2%) at 29-42 days post-calving to 4/379 (1.1%) between
      295 and 383 days after calving. The effects of the four treatment groups were not
      significantly different from each other for overall lameness period prevalence,
      biweekly lameness point prevalence, time to first lameness event, type of foot
      lesion identified at dry off claw trimming, or the 4% fat corrected 305-day milk 
      yield. However, increased odds lameness was significantly associated with a
      pre-calving trim alone (P = 0.044) compared to the reference group LL. The odds
      of heifer lameness were highest between 0 and 6 weeks post-partum, and heifer
      farm destination was significantly associated with lameness (OR 2.24), suggesting
      that even at high standard facilities, environment and management systems have
      more effect on heifer foot health than trimming.

TI  - Efficacy of a polyvalent mastitis vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus on a
      dairy Mediterranean buffalo farm: results of two clinical field trials.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s12917-017-0944-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last years the knowledges on Mediterranean Buffalo (MB)
      mastitis is remarkably improving, nevertheless the attention has been never
      focused on vaccination as preventive strategy for the control of mastitis in
      these ruminates. The aim of the current study was to assess clinical efficacy
      over time of two different preventive vaccination protocols against S. aureus
      mastitis, in primiparous MB.Vaccinated (VG) and not-vaccinated (N-VG) groups, of 
      30 MB each one, were selected from two different herds (herd A: VG1 and N-VG1;
      herd B: VG2 and N-VG2) of the same farm. Herd A received a double vaccination
      (Startvac(R), 45 and 10 days before calving, protocol A), while in herd B an
      additional administration was performed (52 days after calving, protocol B).
      Bacteriological milk culture and assessment of somatic cell count (SCC) were
      performed at 10, 30, 60 and 90 days in milk (DIM) from composite milk samples.
      After 90 DIM, daily milk yields and SCC values were monthly detected until
      dry-off. RESULTS: The overall incidence of positive MB for S. aureus was 40.8%
      (49/120) in VG1 and 43.3% (52/120) in N-VG1 (Protocol A), while 45.8% (55/120)
      and 50.8% (61/120) in VG2 and N-VG2 (Protocol B). The latter was associated with 
      a significant decreased in prevalence (at 90 DIM) and incidence of mastitis
      (animals positive for S. aureus, SCC > 200^10(3), with or without clinical signs)
      in the vaccinated MB, while no difference occurred in protocol A. Moreover, herd 
      B showed a significant reduction in prevalence of intramammary infection (animals
      positive for S. aureus, SCC < 200^10(3), no clinical signs) in the vaccinated MB 
      at 60 DIM while no differences were detected in herd A, at any sampling time;
      N-VG2 had significantly higher overall SCC values than VG2 (4.97 +/- 4.75 and
      4.84 +/- 4.60 Log10 cells/mL +/- standard deviation, respectively), while no
      differences were recorded in herd A. CONCLUSIONS: The current investigation
      explores for the first time the clinical efficacy of vaccinations against S.
      aureus infections in MB, showing encouraging results regarding reduction in
      mastitis and somatic cell count; the polyvalent mastitis vaccine may be
      considered an additional tool for in-herd S aureus infection and should be
      associated to other control procedures to maximize its properties.

TI  - A High Rate of Non-Compliance Confounds the Study of Whole Grains and Weight
      Maintenance in a Randomised Intervention Trial-The Case for Greater Use of
      Dietary Biomarkers in Nutrition Intervention Studies.
LID - E55 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu9010055 [doi]
AB  - Observational studies consistently find an inverse relationship between
      whole-grain intake and weight gain. We aimed to confirm this in an open-label
      researcher-blinded parallel design randomised trial. A total of 179
      overweight/obese women with a habitually low whole-grain intake (<16 g/day) were 
      randomised to a weight maintenance diet with refined-grain (RG) or whole-grain
      (WG) foods (80 g/day) for 12 weeks after an initial weight loss program over 8
      weeks. Body weight and composition was assessed at baseline, after the initial
      weight loss, and after the 12-week dietary intervention. During the 12-week
      dietary intervention phase, there were no group differences in changes in body
      weight and total fat mass %, whereas abdominal fat mass tended to increase more
      during the dietary intervention phase in the WG compared to the RG group (0.7 (SD
      3.6) vs. -0.3 (SD 3.8) %; p = 0.052). Plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations,
      biomarkers of wholegrain wheat and rye intake, indicated poor compliance,
      particularly in the WG group, where >60% of participants had alkylresorcinol
      concentrations below 70 nmol/L, a concentration indicating low or no intake of
      whole-grain wheat. Further, weight regain was lower than expected in both
      intervention groups, further supporting a lack of compliance to the
      post-weight-loss diet. The rate of compliance was too low to conclude any effect 
      of whole grain on weight maintenance, and reinforces the need to use objective
      measures of compliance in nutrition intervention studies.

TI  - Behavior of Pigs Reared in Enriched Environment: Alternatives to Extend Pigs
      Attention.
PG  - e0168427
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168427 [doi]
AB  - Three trials were carried out in a completely randomized design aiming to assess 
      the behavior of pigs in growth phase in enriched environments. Trial 1 evaluated 
      the effects of frequency of availability of environmental enrichment. The animals
      were assigned to four treatments: 1) control with no enrichment object; 2)
      objects provided for six consecutive days uninterruptedly; 3) objects provided on
      alternate days, and 4) objects provided for six consecutive days taken away by
      the end of the afternoon and replaced at dawn. Trial 2 assessed the effects of
      scent on animals' acceptance and maintenance of interest in objects. Animals were
      assigned to four treatments: 1) unscented object; 2) object with banana scent; 3)
      object with rum scent; 4) object with scents alternated every other day. Trial 3 
      aimed to assess the influence of environmental enrichment based on providing
      rewards at different difficulty levels. Animals were assigned to three
      treatments: 1) object with no reward; 2) object with a reward at an easy level;
      3) object with a reward at a difficult level. Each trial had six days of
      behavioral observations every ten minutes for eight hours each day using images
      from video cameras. Enrichment objects stimulated the animals' natural behavior
      of nuzzling and exploring the environment. The way the objects were available did
      not impact the success of their use. Offering enrichment on alternate days or
      removing the objects by the end of the day was not an effective strategy to
      extend the animals' interest. The olfactory stimulus in environmental enrichment 
      objects had no positive effect on extending the animals' interest on them, nor
      did alternating the aromas. The tactile stimulus was a key factor for object
      attractiveness. Providing environmental enrichment objects with rewards
      stimulated the exploratory behavior of pigs. The level of difficulty to obtain
      the reward may discourage the animals.

TI  - Effect of ewe prolificacy potential and stocking rate on ewe and lamb performance
      in a grass-based lamb production system.
PG  - 154-164
LID - 10.2527/jas.2016.0772 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of ewe
      prolificacy potential (PP; predicted number of lambs born per ewe per year) as
      dictated by sire breed type, stocking rate (SR; ewes per ha), and their
      interaction on ewe and lamb performance in a temperate grass-based lamb
      production system. The study was a 2 x 3 factorial design, consisting of 2
      differing ewe PP and 3 SR which included 180 medium prolificacy potential (MP-
      Suffolk-sired crossbred ewes) and 180 high prolificacy potential ewes (HP-
      Belclare-sired crossbred ewes) allocated to 1 of 3 ( = 60 ewes) SR: low (LSR; 10 
      ewes per ha), medium (MSR; 12 ewes per ha) or high (HSR: 14 ewes per ha). Each
      treatment was managed in a 5-paddock rotational grazing system for the duration
      of the study. Medium prolificacy ewes were consistently heavier ( < 0.001)
      compared to HP ewes, with HP ewes having a higher BCS at lambing and 6 wk
      post-lambing (PL; < 0.05). Low SR ewes had a higher BW ( < 0.05) and BCS ( <
      0.05) at mating, 6 wk PL, and weaning relative to MSR and HSR ewes which did not 
      differ from each other. Lambs born to MP ewes were heavier at birth and weaning (
      < 0.001) and achieved a higher ADG from birth to weaning ( < 0.05). Ewe PP had no
      effect on lifetime ADG or d to slaughter (DTS) with HP lambs yielding a higher
      carcass weight ( < 0.001). Low SR and MSR lambs achieved higher ADG from birth to
      weaning ( < 0.001) and weaning weight ( < 0.001) relative to HSR lambs and did
      not differ from each other, while post-weaning and lifetime lamb ADG was highest 
      at the LSR, intermediate at the MSR, and lowest at the HSR ( < 0.001). A ewe PP
      by SR interaction existed for DTS, with MP lambs at the LSR reaching slaughter
      weight earlier ( < 0.01) relative to HP lambs, while at the MSR and HSR, MP and
      HP lambs did not differ from each other. High PP ewes produced a higher average
      born ( < 0.001) and weaned litter size per ewe ( < 0.01), with live weight weaned
      per ha ( < 0.001) increasing as ewe PP and SR increased. Lambing difficulty, ewe 
      mother ability and lamb viability did not differ by ewe PP or SR. In conclusion, 
      the lack of interaction between ewe PP and SR on many key performance measures in
      this study demonstrates the potential to increase the live weight of lamb weaned 
      per ha through the use of higher ewe PP and SR levels, with no effect of ewe PP
      on lifetime lamb performance even as SR increased, with reductions in lamb
      performance primarily occurring at the HSR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of a grocery store tour for parents and
      their adolescents being led by adults or adolescent peers. DESIGN: Randomized
      controlled pilot study with surveys at baseline and post-program, and at 3- and
      6-month follow-up. SETTING: Midwestern midsized grocery stores. PARTICIPANTS:
      Sixty-one parents and their 71 11- to 14-year-old adolescents. INTERVENTION:
      Nutrition education during 1 90-minute grocery store tour. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Process observations and participants' tour perceptions provided fidelity
      outcomes. Questionnaires quantitatively assessed participants' knowledge,
      self-efficacy, and tour strategy use. ANALYSIS: Chi-square and McNemar tests were
      used to analyze categorical data, and Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and
      Mann-Whitney U tests were employed for continuous variables (significance at P < 
      .05). RESULTS: Over 90% of tour tasks were rated as completed well for adult and 
      peer leaders. Participants had positive tour perceptions but noted deficiencies
      in teen leaders' knowledge and leadership skills. Overall, parents and
      adolescents retained increased self-efficacy from pre-tour to post-tour
      intervals. Despite limited knowledge retention, parents reported they had
      increased (6.5 +/- 4.19) healthful grocery shopping behaviors in the 6 months
      after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Peers may feasibly lead
      grocery store tours but they may need additional resources and support to be
      highly effective.

LID - S1499-4046(17)30227-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jneb.2017.04.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the impact of Cooking Matters for Adults (CM) on food
      resource management (FRM) skills and self-confidence 6 months after course
      completion. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental design with nonequivalent comparison group
      and 6-month follow-up. SETTING: Cooking Matters for Adults programs in CA, CO,
      ME, MA, MI, and OR. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in CM attending classes in April
      to July, 2016 (n = 332); comparison group (n = 336). INTERVENTION: Cooking
      Matters for Adults educated low-income adults to shop for and prepare healthy
      meals economically using hands-on meal preparation, facilitated discussion, and
      an interactive grocery store tour. Classes met for 2 hours, once a week for 6
      weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Food resource management practices; FRM
      self-confidence (ie, in shopping for and preparing healthy foods on a budget);
      worrying that food might run out. ANALYSIS: Pearson's chi-square test and t tests
      identified measures associated with outcomes of interest and between-group
      differences. Repeated-measures linear mixed models with fixed and random effects 
      were used to examine differences in outcomes between participants in CM and
      nonequivalent comparison group and to estimate the treatment effect of the
      program at 3 and 6 months after course completion. RESULTS: Six months after
      course completion, CM participants demonstrated improvements in all outcome
      measures of interest: Use of FRM practices improved (P = .002) as did FRM
      confidence (P < .001). Participants also worried less that food would run out
      before they had money to buy more (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This
      study demonstrated a positive impact of including FRM skills and confidence
      building in a nutrition education program, the effects of which could be seen for
      6 months after participation in the program. Equipping low-income families with
      FRM skills allowed them to access healthier foods even during times of hardship.

TI  - Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Insulin Resistance after Two Hypocaloric Diets
      with Different Fat Distribution in Obese Subjects: Effect of the rs10767664 Gene 
      Variant in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.
PG  - 163-171
LID - 10.1159/000485248 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) variants on
      change in body weight and cardiovascular risk factors after weight loss remains
      unclear in obese patients. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the effects of the
      rs10767664 BDNF gene polymorphism on body weight, cardiovascular risk factors,
      and serum adipokine levels after a high monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)
      hypocaloric diet (diet M) versus a high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      hypocaloric diet (diet P). METHODS: A Caucasian population of 361 obese patients 
      was enrolled. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to 
      one of two diets for a period of 3 months. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen
      subjects (59.8%) had the genotype AA (wild-type group), and 145 (40.2%) patients 
      had the genotypes AT (122 patients, 33.8%) or TT (23 patients, 6.4%) (mutant-type
      group). After weight loss with diet P and diet M and in both genotype groups,
      body mass index, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, 
      serum leptin levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol
      decreased in a significant way. Secondary to weight loss with diet M and only in 
      the wild-type group, insulin levels (-2.1 +/- 2.0 vs. -0.7 +/- 2.9 IU/L, p <
      0.05) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (-0.7 +/- 0.9 vs.
      -0.3 +/- 1.0 U, p < 0.05) decreased. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the
      rs10767664 variant of the BDNF gene modifies insulin resistance and insulin
      levels after weight loss with a hypocaloric diet enriched with MUFAs.

TI  - The Effect of Genistein Supplementation on Vitamin D Levels and Bone Turnover
      Markers during the Summer in Healthy Postmenopausal Women: Role of Genotypes of
      Isoflavone Metabolism.
PG  - 139-145
LID - 10.1159/000484480 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to determine whether vitamin D and
      genistein supplementation had an additive beneficial effect on levels of vitamin 
      D and bone markers and whether this effect was mediated by genes regulating
      isoflavone metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective study 
      in postmenopausal women randomized to calcium and vitamin D supplementation or
      calcium, vitamin D, and genistein supplementation. Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone
      (PTH), cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen 1 N-terminal (P1NP) were
      determined by electrochemiluminescence. Three SNPs - rs2231142 (ABCG2), rs358231 
      (cytosolic beta-glucosidase [CBG]), and rs2273697 (ABCC2) - were determined.
      RESULTS: We included 102 women. The effects on bone remodeling were similar:
      rises in vitamin D were significantly associated with reductions in PTH, CTX, and
      P1NP. Pharmacogenomic analysis of the genotypes showed that, in AT heterozygotes 
      of the CBG1368T>A polymorphism, CTX and P1NP were not reduced. CONCLUSION:
      Genistein added to calcium and vitamin D supplementation had no additional
      effect. The supplementation of individual AT heterozygotes of the CBG1368T>A
      polymorphism had no effect on markers of bone remodeling.

      Cardiovascular Risk Biomarkers and Adipokines to Two Hypocaloric Diets.
PG  - 63-72
LID - 10.1159/000478528 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Our aim was to evaluate the relationship of weight loss and changes in
      adipokine levels after two hypocaloric diets in obese subjects with polymorphism 
      rs16147 of the neuropeptide Y gene. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A population of 283
      obese patients was analyzed. At the basal visit, patients were randomly allocated
      to one of two diets for a period of 3 months (diet I, low in carbohydrates; diet 
      II, low in fat). RESULTS: With diet I and in both genotype groups (major versus
      minor allele), body mass index (BMI), weight, fat mass, waist circumference, and 
      leptin decreased. With diet II and in all genotypes, BMI, weight, fat mass, waist
      circumference, and leptin decreased. With both diets and in subjects with the
      minor allele, insulin levels (diet I: major allele -1.7 +/- 7.8 IU/L versus minor
      allele -4.2 +/- 6.1 IU/L, p = 0.01; diet II: major allele -2.3 +/- 6.1 IU/L
      versus minor allele -4.0 +/- 5.2 IU/L, p = 0.02) and insulin resistance (diet I: 
      major allele -0.2 +/- 3.1 units versus minor allele -1.7 +/- 3.0 units, p = 0.03;
      diet II: major allele -0.9 +/- 2.0 units versus minor allele -1.7 +/- 1.3 units, 
      p = 0.01) decreased. CONCLUSION: The rs16147 genotype affected the reduction in
      insulin resistance and insulin levels in response to two different hypocaloric
      diets in obese subjects, with a lack of response in subjects with the major
      allele.

TI  - RE-AIM Analysis of a School-Based Nutrition Education Intervention in
      Kindergarteners.
PG  - 36-46
LID - 10.1111/josh.12466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few nutrition interventions in kindergarten classes have been
      evaluated, and none has been tested for program effectiveness, implementation,
      and dissemination. Building a Healthy Me (BHM) is a nutrition intervention for
      kindergarteners that is classroom-based and includes a family component. This
      study evaluated the public health impact of BHM in California kindergarten
      classrooms using the RE-AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and
      maintenance) framework. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design assessed pre-to-post
      changes in nutrition knowledge, dietary consumption, and parent behaviors of 25
      intervention classrooms (414 students, 264 parents); and postintervention
      differences in nutrition knowledge between the intervention classrooms and 4
      control classrooms measured at postintervention only (103 students). RESULTS:
      Intervention students improved in knowledge of food groups and healthy
      breakfast/snack options, and scored higher than control students in food group
      knowledge at postintervention (ps < .05). Parents of intervention group children 
      increased their use of food labels, and intervention group children increased
      intake of several healthy foods and decreased intake of candy and fried potatoes 
      (ps < .05). The BHM program reached 41% of kindergarteners attending public
      schools in California, and teachers implemented most lesson material.
      CONCLUSIONS: The BHM program was effective, implemented with fidelity, and
      broadly disseminated, highlighting its potential public health impact for
      kindergarteners.

TI  - Polymorphism of the Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Gene (TCF7L2) Interacts with
      Obesity on Type-2 Diabetes in the PREDIMED Study Emphasizing the Heterogeneity of
      Genetic Variants in Type-2 Diabetes Risk Prediction: Time for Obesity-Specific
      Genetic Risk Scores.
LID - E793 [pii]
AB  - Nutrigenetic studies analyzing gene-diet interactions of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 C >
      T polymorphism on type-2 diabetes (T2D) have shown controversial results. A
      reason contributing to this may be the additional modulation by obesity.
      Moreover, TCF7L2-rs7903146 is one of the most influential variants in T2D-genetic
      risk scores (GRS). Therefore, to increase the predictive value (PV) of GRS it is 
      necessary to first see whether the included polymorphisms have heterogeneous
      effects. We comprehensively investigated gene-obesity interactions between the
      TCF7L2-rs7903146 C > T polymorphism on T2D (prevalence and incidence) and
      analyzed other T2D-polymorphisms in a sub-sample. We studied 7018 PREDIMED
      participants at baseline and longitudinally (8.7 years maximum follow-up).
      Obesity significantly interacted with the TCF7L2-rs7903146 on T2D prevalence,
      associations being greater in non-obese subjects. Accordingly, we prospectively
      observed in non-T2D subjects (n = 3607) that its association with T2D incidence
      was stronger in non-obese (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.13-2.92, p = 0.013 for TT versus
      CC) than in obese subjects (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.61-1.66; p = 0.979; p-interaction
      = 0.048). Accordingly, TCF7L2-PV was higher in non-obese subjects. Additionally, 
      we created obesity-specific GRS with ten T2D-polymorphisms and demonstrated for
      the first time their higher strata-specific PV. In conclusion, we provide strong 
      evidence supporting the need for considering obesity when analyzing the TCF7L2
      effects and propose the use of obesity-specific GRS for T2D.

TI  - Does Fluoride Affect Serum Testosterone and Androgen Binding Protein with
      Age-Specificity? A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study in Chinese Male
      Farmers.
PG  - 294-299
AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that exposure to excess fluoride was associated
      with a variety of diseases. Little is known about the variation of testosterone
      (T) levels caused by fluoride exposure. The aim of this study is to explore the
      association of fluoride exposure and age with serum T and androgen-binding
      protein (ABP) levels in male farmers. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a 
      county of Henan Province, China, including high fluoride exposure from drinking
      water villages and control villages. Male farmers aged 18-55 years old who lived 
      in these villages were recruited by cluster sampling and divided into a higher
      fluoride exposure group (HFG) and a lower fluoride exposure group (LFG) according
      to the level of urinary fluoride. Levels of T and ABP in serum were measured
      using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA) respectively. Markedly lower T levels were observed in male farmers from 
      the HFG than in those from the LFG (t = 2.496, P < 0.05). Furthermore, younger
      farmers, 18-29 and 30-39 years old, may be the most likely to have lower T levels
      when exposed to fluoride (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in 
      serum ABP levels in all male farmers between the two groups with different
      fluoride exposure. These results supported that excess fluoride exposure
      decreased serum T levels of male farmers with age-specificity.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this operational study was to assess the effectiveness
      school-based health and nutrition intervention supported with backyard gardening 
      on the dietary diversity among school adolescents. METHODS: A total of 1000
      school adolescents from 10 to 19years were selected randomly. The intervention
      involved peer-led behavior change communication and health promotion through
      school media and health clubs. Data were collected at baseline, midline and
      end-line using structured questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression
      analyses were used to determine the independent effect of interventions. RESULTS:
      There was a significant increment of proportion of school children consuming
      diversified diet among the intervention group from 34.8% at baseline through
      65.6% at midline to 74.7% at the end-line (p<0.001). Among control group, there
      was no change from midline (49.4%) to endline (48.8%), though there was a change 
      from baseline (32.1%) to midline (49.4%). A significant difference of dietary
      diversity intake was observed between intervention and control groups at midline 
      (F=5.64, p=0.042) and endline (F=5.85, p<0.001) survey. Being in the intervention
      school (OR=2.55 [1.55, 3.50]), being a boy (OR=1.75 [1.91, 2.56]) and having
      farmer mothers (OR=2.58 [1.01, 6.87]) were independent positive predictors of a
      diversified diet intake. However, having a mother who attended secondary schools 
      were inversely associated (OR=0.25 [0.06, 0.97]) with consuming a diversified
      diet. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study demonstrated that there was a
      significant improvement in dietary diversity of adolescents in intervention
      schools. The results imply that school based nutrition education should be a part
      of comprehensive school health programs to reach students and potentially their
      families.

TI  - Effects of cows grazing toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue or novel
      endophyte-infected tall fescue in late gestation on cow performance,
      reproduction, and progeny growth performance and carcass characteristics.
PG  - 5105-5113
LID - 10.2527/jas.2016-0819 [doi]
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of cow exposure to toxic ergot
      alkaloids in late gestation and the subsequent, long-term effects on progeny.
      Therefore, the objectives were to determine the effects of grazing toxic
      endophyte-infected tall fescue () or novel endophyte-infected tall fescue during 
      late gestation on cow BW, BCS, hair coat score (HCS), respiration rates, milk
      production, and reproduction and on growth performance and carcass
      characteristics of progeny. Eighty gestating, Angus x Simmental cows (age = 6.68 
      +/- 0.32 yr; 588 +/- 16 kg initial BW; initial BCS = 5.66 +/- 0.28) were
      stratified by initial BW and allocated into 8 pasture groups (10 cows/group) with
      4 groups per treatment. Each group was allotted to 1 of 2 grazing treatments:
      toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue ('Kentucky-31'; E+) or novel
      endophyte-infected tall fescue ('Jesup MaxQ'; NOV). Cows were placed on grazing
      treatments at 110 +/- 6 d prepartum (May 28, 2014) and remained on treatment
      until the end of the calving period (October 8, 2014; 23 +/- 6 d postpartum). Cow
      BW and BCS did not diverge ( >/= 0.15) at any time point among grazing
      treatments. However, cows grazing E+ had increased ( < 0.05) respiration rates
      and HCS and reduced ( < 0.05) prolactin concentration compared with cows grazing 
      NOV. Calf birth BW, Julian calving date, milk production, AI conception rate, and
      overall pregnancy rate did not differ ( >/= 0.23) by grazing treatment. In a
      subsequent grazing period of the progeny, dam grazing treatment did not affect ( 
      >/= 0.14) respiration rates, HCS, or prolactin concentration of the progeny when 
      all progeny grazed E+ pastures. However, progeny born to dams grazing NOV tended 
      ( > 0.06 to </=0.10) to have increased BW at 70 +/- 6 d of age, 205 d (adjusted
      weaning BW), and throughout the postweaning calf grazing period. Despite a
      tendency for BW to differ throughout the postweaning calf grazing period,
      finishing phase performance and carcass characteristics of progeny did not differ
      ( >/= 0.20) between dam grazing treatment. In conclusion, results indicate that
      by the time progeny enter the feedlot and are finished on a high-grain diet, any 
      fetal programming effects are minimal.

TI  - Effectiveness of a new dietetic weight management food to achieve weight loss in 
      client-owned obese cats.
PG  - 947-953
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate weight loss and maintenance
      parameters in cats fed a novel weight management food and to assess the owner's
      perception of the cat's quality of life. METHODS: This study was designed as a
      prospective, uncontrolled/unmasked clinical trial. One hundred and thirty-two
      overweight/obese, otherwise healthy, client-owned cats were enrolled. Initial
      evaluation included physical examination, nutritional assessment, ideal body
      weight determination and weight-loss feeding guidelines development. Follow-up
      evaluations (monthly for 6 months) encompassed determination of body weight, body
      condition score, body fat index, muscle condition score and feeding practices.
      Quality of life assessment by owners included the cat's level of energy,
      happiness, appetite, begging behavior, flatulence, stool volume and fecal score. 
      RESULTS: Eighty-three percent of the cats lost weight, with an average +/- SEM
      weight loss of 11.0 +/- 1.8% over 6 months and an average +/- SE weekly weight
      loss rate of 0.45 +/- 0.02%. The mean +/- SEM duration of weight loss was 134.0
      +/- 4.8 days. Fourteen percent of cats achieved an ideal body weight.
      Seventy-nine percent of cats ate more calories from novel weight management food 
      than the recommended daily energy requirement for weight loss, and the majority
      of these cats still lost weight. Body condition score and body fat index
      decreased over time compared with baseline from weeks 12-24 and from weeks 8-24, 
      respectively. Owners perceived an increase in energy and happiness (>week 12) in 
      the cats that lost weight, without changes in appetite or begging behavior.
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study confirmed the effectiveness of the novel
      weight management food in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese client-owned 
      cats. Owners reported significant improvements in their cat's quality of life
      without negative side effects.

AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of energy sources and
      levels on body and organs weights, thyroid hormones, and heat shock protein
      (HSP70) gene expression in broilers under heat stress. In a completely randomized
      design, 600 1-day-old Cobb chickens were assigned to five dietary treatments and 
      four replicates. The chickens were fed diet based on corn as main energy source
      and energy level based on Cobb standard considered as control (C), corn-based
      diet with 3 % lesser energy than the control (T1), corn-based diet with 6 %
      lesser energy than the control (T2), corn and soybean oil-based diet according to
      Cobb standard (T3), and corn and soybean oil-based diet with 3 % upper energy
      than the control (T4). Temperature was increased to 34 degrees C for 8 h daily
      from days 12 to 41 of age to induce heat stress. The chickens in T1 and T2 had
      lower thyroid hormones and corticosterone levels than those in C, T3, and T4. The
      highest liver weight was for C and the lowest one was for T4. The highest gene
      expression was found in chickens fed T4 diet, and the lowest gene expression was 
      for those in T2 group. The highest feed intake and worse feed conversion ratio
      was related to chickens in T2. The chickens in T3 and T4 had higher feed intake
      and weight gain than those in C. The results showed that the higher energy level 
      supplied from soybean oil could enhance gene expression of HSP70 and decline the 
      level of corticosterone and thyroid hormones and consequently improved
      performance.

TI  - Supplementation of banana flower powder pellet and plant oil sources on in vitro 
      ruminal fermentation, digestibility, and methane production.
PG  - 1673-1678
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of banana flower power
      pellet (BAFLOP-pellet) and plant oil source on in vitro gas production,
      fermentation efficiency, and methane (CH4) production. Rumen fluid was collected 
      from two rumen-fistulated dairy steers fed on rice straw-based diet with
      concentrate supplement to maintain normal rumen ecology. All supplemented feed
      were added to respective treatments in the 30:70 roughage to concentrate-based
      substrate. The treatments were arranged according to a 3 x 3 factorial
      arrangement in a completely randomized design. First factor was different levels 
      of BAFLOP-pellet supplementation (0, 30, and 60 g/kg of dietary substrate) and
      second factor was plant oil source supplementation [non-supplemented, 20 g/kg
      krabok seed oil (KSO), and 20 g/kg coconut oil (CO) of dietary substrate,
      respectively]. Under this investigation, BAFLOP-pellet supplementation increased 
      gas production kinetics and in vitro digestibility (P < 0.05). Ruminal pH was
      dropped post incubation time in the non-supplemented group but was enhanced in
      BAFLOP-pellet-supplemented treatments. On the other hand, supplementation of KSO 
      and CO depressed gas production and digestibility, but did not influence ruminal 
      pH. In addition, protozoal population and CH4 production were decreased by
      BAFLOP-pellet and plant oil addition (P < 0.05). Based on this study, it could be
      concluded that supplementation of BAFLOP-pellet and plant oil source could
      enhance the in vitro fermentation efficiency while reduced protozoal population
      and CH4 production. It is suggested that BAFLOP-pellet (60 g/kg of dietary
      substrate) and KSO/CO (20 g/kg of dietary substrate) could be used to manipulate 
      rumen fermentation characteristics fed on high-concentrate diet.

TI  - Growth performance and meat quality of rabbits under different feeding regimes.
PG  - 1661-1666
AB  - This study evaluated the growth, carcass characteristics and meat quality of
      indigenous rabbits in northern Pakistan. Weaned rabbits (age 35 days, weight 323 
      g) of four distinct phenotypes (white, black and white, brown and black) were fed
      four experimental diets: alfalfa hay (AH), berseem fodder (BF), BF supplemented
      with low-level concentrate (50 %; LLC) and high-level concentrate (75 %; HLC).
      Each experimental diet was fed to 48 rabbits, 12 of each phenotype, in a
      randomized complete block design. The duration of the experiment was 55 days,
      including 1 week of adaptation. Rabbits fed the BF and AH diets had poor body
      weight gain (P < 0.05) compared to rabbits fed the LLC and HLC diets. Feed
      conversion efficiency was best in the LLC (4.47) and HLC (4.58) groups. Average
      carcass yield (743 g) and carcass dressing percentage (56.2) were higher (P <
      0.05) in LLC. Growth rate was not improved significantly by feeding HLC. Fat
      deposition in animals was higher (P < 0.05) in the groups supplemented with
      concentrate. Cost per kilogram of rabbit meat was lowest (P < 0.05) for BF,
      followed by AH, LLC and HLC. Brown phenotypes had the best (P < 0.05) feed
      conversion efficiency, body weight gain, carcass yield and carcass dressing. It
      was concluded that local rabbits do not necessarily need high levels of
      concentrates but can be well fattened with low-level concentrates along with
      forages.

TI  - Supplementation with Ca salts of soybean oil interacts with concentrate level in 
      grazing dairy cows: intake, ingestive behavior, and ruminal parameters.
PG  - 1593-1598
AB  - In this study, we investigated the associative effects of concentrate levels and 
      Ca salts of soybean oil (CSSO) supplementation on performance and ruminal
      parameters of mid-lactation dairy cows grazing on tropical pasture. Twenty-four
      Jersey x Holstein cows were used in a randomized block design and assigned to
      four treatments arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Factors evaluated were
      concentrate levels (low, 3 kg/day vs. high, 7 kg/day of concentrate) and CSSO
      supplementation (without CSSO vs. with 250 g CSSO cow/day). All cows grazed on
      elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum cv. Cameroon) and received the supplemental 
      treatments for a 90-day period. The high concentrate level decreased forage
      intake and grazing time. In addition, the high concentrate level increased rumen 
      propionate concentration and microbial synthesis and tended to decrease ammonia-N
      compared with low concentrate level. The addition of CSSO tended to decrease
      valerate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, and microbial synthesis. In conclusion,
      feeding CSSO for mid lactating cows grazing on tropical pasture had negative
      effects on rumen function. In contrast, CSSO supplementation tended to interact
      with concentrate level and increased energy intake when fed at low concentrate
      level. Feeding the high level of concentrate was an effective strategy to
      increase energy intake and microbial synthesis and improve N utilization.

TI  - Supplementation with Ca salts of soybean oil interacts with concentrate level in 
      grazing dairy cows: milk production and milk composition.
PG  - 1585-1591
AB  - In this study, we investigated the associative effects of concentrate levels and 
      Ca salts of soybean oil (CSSO) supplementation on milk production, milk
      composition, and milk fatty acids of mid-lactation dairy cows grazing on tropical
      pasture. Twenty-four Jersey x Holstein cows were used in a randomized block
      design and assigned to four treatments arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design.
      Factors evaluated were concentrate levels (low, 3 kg/day vs. high, 7 kg/day of
      concentrate) and CSSO supplementation (without CSSO vs. with 250 g CSSO cow/day).
      All cows grazed on elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum cv. Cameroon) and
      received the supplemental treatments for a 90-day period. Interactions between
      concentrate level and CSSO were detected for milk yield, milk yield components,
      energy-corrected milk (ECM) and 3.5 % fat-corrected milk (FCM). Milk yield
      increased when CSSO was fed in a low concentrate level, while it decreased milk
      production in a high concentrate level. Yields of fat, protein, lactose, 3.5 %
      FCM, and ECM were not affected with CSSO in the low concentrate, but reduced in
      the high concentrate level. CSSO increased proportions of monounsaturated milk
      FA, C18:2 trans-10 cis-12, and polyunsaturated FA, and reduced proportions of
      saturated milk FA in milk. In conclusion, feeding the high level of concentrate
      was an effective strategy to improve milk yield and solid production. CSSO
      supplementation increased milk production when fed at low concentrate level but
      did not affect yield of solids.

TI  - The effects of energy and protein supplementation strategy and frequency on the
      performance of beef cattle that grazed on Tanzania grass pastures during the
      rainy season.
PG  - 1561-1567
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the different supplementation
      strategies for finishing Nellore beef cattle on pastures of Tanzania guinea grass
      (Panicum maximum Jacq. 'Tanzania'). The experiment was performed in a 12 ha area 
      divided into 12 paddocks of 1 ha each. Forty-eight, 2-year-old, non-castrated
      Nellore cattle with an initial body weight (BW) of 384 kg (SEM = 21) were used in
      this study. The following supplementation strategies were evaluated: (1) mineral 
      supplement supplied once per week (MS), (2) energy and protein supplement with
      intake regulator (2 g/kg BW) supplied once per week (EPS1), (3) energy and
      protein supplement (7 g/kg BW) supplied daily (EPS2), and (4) energy and protein 
      supplement (7 g/kg BW) supplied three times per week (EPS3). The average daily
      gain (ADG) of animals receiving EPS3 was 0.177 kg/day higher than those receiving
      EPS1 (p < 0.01), 0.233 kg/day higher than the MS group, and not significantly
      different from EPS2. Animals in MS and EPS1 groups exhibited the lowest ADG. The 
      ADG was not significantly different between EPS1 and EPS2 animals, but was 0.203 
      kg/day higher for EPS2 animals than for MS. Animals receiving only mineral
      supplementation spent more time grazing than the other supplementation groups
      tested (p < 0.01). We therefore conclude that Tanzania guinea grass is
      nutritionally limited and can be amended using supplements, thereby increasing
      animal performance. Animal performance was higher with increased protein and
      energy supplementation (7 g/kg BW), independent of the frequency with which
      supplements were administered.

TI  - Research protocol for a digital intervention to reduce stigma among males with a 
      personal experience of suicide in the Australian farming community.
PG  - 1204
AB  - BACKGROUND: Australian farming communities have up to twice the suicide rate of
      the general population. Men, particularly, demonstrate debilitating self- and
      perceived-stigma associated with an experience of suicide. The Ripple Effect is
      aimed to reduce suicide stigma within the social, cultural, geographical and
      psychological contexts in which it occurs. METHODS: A mixed-method design with
      multi-level evaluation will be effected following the development and delivery of
      a personalised website experience (combining shared stories, education, personal 
      goal setting and links to resources) to farming men, aged 30-64 years, with an
      experience of suicide. Pre- and post-surveys will be used to assess changes in
      self- and perceived-stigma and suicide literacy. Online feedback from
      participants and semi-structured interviews during follow-up will be thematically
      analysed. DISCUSSION: This project will provide information about increasingly
      accessible, innovative approaches to reducing the debilitating health and
      wellbeing effects of suicide stigma on a population of Australia's farmers. TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: This research protocol was registered with the Australian New
      Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (ACTRN: ACTRN12616000289415 ) on 7(th) 
      March, 2016.

TI  - Which Design Components of Nutrition Infographics Make Them Memorable and
      Compelling?
PG  - 779-787
LID - 10.5993/AJHB.40.6.10 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Which design features of nutrition infographics make them memorable
      and compelling? METHODS: First, we conducted 3 focus groups with a total of 28
      participants to understand preferred infographic characteristics of adults who
      were mostly in their early 20s. Second, using between subject design, a slide
      show of single-image infographics was displayed to an independent sample of
      college students and young career university employees (N = 50). We assigned
      participants randomly to either active or passive processing conditions. We
      conducted correlation and regression analyses to examine differences in recall
      and intention by infographic characteristics and processing conditions. RESULTS: 
      Regardless of whether a person was actively or passively viewing the
      infographics, the most robust predictor of recall was an action-oriented title (p
      = .003). Surprisingly, infographics in color (vs black-and-white), humorous, or
      simply worded were no more memorable or effective than if they simply had
      actionable titles. CONCLUSIONS: Action-oriented titles make infographics
      memorable and compelling. Regardless of how involved a person is in processing an
      infographic, cartoon, or illustration, time spent on perfecting an
      action-oriented title will be time better spent than on making the infographic
      colorful, humorous, or detailed. Whereas content and detail of the infographic
      are important, effectiveness might be improved by the command given in its title 
      or subtitle.

TI  - Ear tagging in piglets: the cortisol response with and without analgesia in
      comparison with castration and tail docking.
PG  - 1864-1870
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to compare the cortisol response caused 
      by ear tagging piglets with the distress caused by other known painful husbandry 
      procedures (e.g. castration and tail docking) and to evaluate the effectiveness
      of analgesia with meloxicam to reduce the cortisol response caused by these
      procedures. In total, 210 male piglets were randomised to equal numbers (n=30)
      into one of seven groups: a control group which was only handled (H), an ear
      tagged group that received no analgesia (ET), an ear tagged group with analgesia 
      (ETM), a castration group with no analgesia (C), a castration group with
      analgesia (CM), a tail-docked group with no analgesia (TD) and a tail-docked
      group with analgesia (TDM). The procedures were carried out on day 3 or 4 after
      farrowing. Five blood samples were taken from each piglet: 30 min before the
      respective procedure (baseline value), and 30, 60 min, 4 and 7 h after
      processing, to assess cortisol concentrations. Means as well as the area under
      the curve (AUC) value were analysed and the effective sizes of the procedures
      were established. At 7 h after the experimental treatment, cortisol
      concentrations had returned to base values in all groups. ET evoked a greater
      cortisol response than H piglets at 30 min (P<0.001) and 60 min (P=0.001). The
      cortisol response to ET was lower than C at 30 min (P=0.001) but did not differ
      significantly at the other sample times. The mean cortisol response was similar
      between ET and TD piglets over all sample times. Taking both intensity and
      duration of the cortisol response into account (AUC), ET evoked a greater
      response than TD. Analgesia (ETM) resulted in significantly lower cortisol levels
      than ET at 30 and 60 min post-procedure. Castration (C) provoked the highest
      cortisol response of all procedures; a significant analgesic effect (CM) was
      shown only at 4 h post-procedure. TD resulted in significantly higher cortisol
      levels than H piglets only at 30 min; analgesia (TDM) significantly reduced the
      cortisol response at 30 min. We conclude that ear tagging causes a dramatic
      increase in cortisol levels compared with handling alone in piglets, which
      suggests that this procedure causes substantial distress. However, further
      research is needed to confirm these results.

TI  - Minimizing cows' stress when calves were early weaned using the two-step method
      with nose flaps.
PG  - 1871-1876
AB  - Early weaning may be used in beef cattle production to improve reproduction rates
      in range conditions. However, weaning causes a stress response in cows, which may
      be especially strong in early weaning management, as the bond between the cow and
      the calf is still strong. We hypothesized that weaning calves in two steps, with 
      the aid of anti-sucking devices (nose flaps) would reduce the behavioural stress 
      response in the cows separated from their calves 2 months after parturition. We
      compared the behaviour frequency and weight change in cows that were weaned
      abruptly, by separation of the calf on day 0 of the study, or in two steps,
      consisting of the use of anti-sucking nose flaps for 5 days before permanent
      separation; a third group was not weaned to serve as control. Thirty-six
      crossbred multiparous Aberdeen AngusxHereford cows and their calves
      (n=12/treatment) were managed in three paddocks with similar pasture
      availability, with four dyads from each treatment per paddock. Cows' behaviour
      was observed by direct visual instantaneous sampling, at 10 min intervals from
      days -3 to 11. Weaning the calves in two steps clearly attenuated the behavioural
      stress response observed in abruptly weaned cows, which included reductions in
      grazing and lying, and increases in pacing, walking and vocalizing. Our results
      corroborate those previously shown for cows nursing older calves, and indicate
      that step weaning can reduce the behavioural stress response of cows at weaning, 
      even when the calf is weaned shortly after birth, when the bond between the cow
      and calf is still very strong.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of dexamethasone as an adjunctive therapy to
      propylene glycol for treatment of hyperketonemia in postpartum dairy cattle.
PG  - 8991-9000
LID - S0022-0302(16)30633-6 [pii]

AB  - Treatment of hyperketonemia with oral propylene glycol has proven efficacy but
      the cure rate remains moderate. Dexamethasone has long been suggested as a
      treatment for hyperketonemia, even though evidence of its efficacy is
      contradictory. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate 
      the effect of adding a single intramuscular injection of 20mg of dexamethasone to
      oral propylene glycol therapy for hyperketonemia [blood beta-hydroxybutyrate
      (BHB) >/=1.2mmol/L]. All cows between 3 and 16d in milk on 4 dairy farms in New
      York State were tested once weekly for hyperketonemia using a handheld ketone
      meter. All enrolled animals received 312g (300mL) of propylene glycol orally once
      daily for 4d and either a single injection of dexamethasone or an equivalent
      volume of sterile saline. A total of 509 animals were enrolled, with 254 and 255 
      in the placebo and dexamethasone groups, respectively. Treatment with
      dexamethasone decreased the odds of being hyperketonemic in the second week
      posttreatment; however, the odds of hyperketonemia in the first week
      posttreatment only decreased in those animals that were treated at a BHB blood
      concentration between 1.2 and 1.5mmol/L. For the 8% of cows with blood BHB
      >3.2mmol/L at enrollment, receiving dexamethasone increased the odds of being
      hyperketonemic the following week. We detected no difference between treatment
      groups in the odds of postpartum disease or in milk production. For cows with
      initial BHB of 1.2 to 1.5mmol/L, treatment with dexamethasone tended to reduce
      the odds of pregnancy at first insemination. Based on the small and conditional
      benefits of dexamethasone and a lack of difference in milk yield or disease
      incidence, we do not recommend the use of dexamethasone to treat hyperketonemia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was evaluating if the presence of a humanoid 
      robot could improve the efficacy of a game-based, nutritional education
      intervention. STUDY DESIGN: This was a controlled, school-based pilot
      intervention carried out on fourth-grade school children (8-10 years old). A
      total of 112 children underwent a game-based nutritional educational lesson on
      the importance of carbohydrates. For one group (n = 58), the lesson was carried
      out by a nutritional educator, the Master of Taste (MT), whereas for another
      group, (n = 54) the Master of Taste was supported by a humanoid robot (MT + NAO).
      A third group of children (n = 33) served as control not receiving any lesson.
      METHODS: The intervention efficacy was evaluated by questionnaires administered
      at the beginning and at the end of each intervention. The nutritional knowledge
      level was evaluated by the cultural-nutritional awareness factor (AF) score.
      RESULTS: A total of 290 questionnaires were analyzed. Both MT and MT + NAO
      interventions significantly increased nutritional knowledge. At the end of the
      study, children in the MT and MT + NAO group showed similar AF scores, and the AF
      scores of both intervention groups were significantly higher than the AF score of
      the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a significant increase in the
      nutritional knowledge of children involved in a game-based, single-lesson,
      educational intervention performed by a figure that has a background in food
      science. However, the presence of a humanoid robot to support this figure's
      teaching activity did not result in any significant learning improvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sodium reduction is very important in preventing cardiovascular
      diseases, especially in regions with high salt intake such as Japan. One strategy
      for salt reduction is to raise consumer awareness of the need to reduce daily
      salt intake. We investigated whether cooking classes given to housewives
      focussing on salt reduction would influence not only their own consumption
      behaviour but also that of their family members. STUDY DESIGN: Single-blinded,
      cluster randomized trial. METHODS: We randomly assigned housewives to participate
      in cooking classes focussing on salt reduction (intervention group) or lectures
      about a healthy lifestyle (control group). The main outcome measure was the
      difference in estimated daily salt intake by spot urine sampling of housewives
      and their family members 2 months after intervention between the groups. RESULTS:
      A total of 35 housewives and 33 family members were randomized. The mean daily
      salt intake was 10.00 (standard deviation [SD] 1.75) g/day in the control group
      (17 housewives and 15 family members) and 9.57 (SD 2.45) g/day in the
      intervention group (18 housewives and 18 family members) at baseline. Two months 
      after the intervention, the mean salt intake was 10.30 (SD 1.78) g/day in the
      control group and 8.95 (SD 2.45) g/day in the intervention group. The mean
      difference was -1.19 g/day (95% confidence interval -2.29, -0.09; P = 0.034). A
      similar tendency was observed in the subgroups of housewives and family members. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our trial suggested that the effects of cooking classes focussing on
      salt reduction for housewives could be transferred to family members (UMIN-CTR:
      000018870).

TI  - Nutrition education linked to agricultural interventions improved child dietary
      diversity in rural Cambodia.
PG  - 1457-1468
AB  - Poor infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are major determinants of
      chronic malnutrition. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact
      of a nutrition education (NE) programme aimed at promoting improved IYCF
      behaviours in combination with an agriculture intervention on children's dietary 
      diversity and nutritional status. From 2012 to 2014, a cluster randomised trial
      was rolled out in Cambodia in the context of an agriculture and nutrition project
      of the FAO of the UN. The cross-sectional baseline study was carried out in
      sixteen pre-selected communes in 2012. Restricted randomisation allotted the
      communes to either intervention (NE and agriculture intervention) or comparison
      arms (agriculture intervention only). The impact survey was conducted as a census
      in all FAO project villages in 2014. Caregivers of children aged 0-23 months were
      interviewed using standardised questions on socio-economic status and dietary
      diversity (24-h recall). Anthropometric measurements were taken. A
      difference-in-differences model was applied. The sample comprised 743 households 
      with children >/=6 months of age at baseline and 921 at impact. After 1 year of
      NE, 69 % of the intervention households reported to have participated in the NE. 
      Estimated mean child dietary diversity was significantly different at impact
      between comparison and intervention (3.6 and 3.9, respectively). In particular,
      the consumption of pro-vitamin A-rich foods and other fruits and vegetables
      increased. No treatment effects on height-for-age Z-scores could be shown. NE led
      to improvements in children's diets. For effects on growth, it is assumed that
      longer NE activities are required to achieve sustainable behaviour change of
      age-appropriate infant feeding.

PG  - 836-43
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12449 [doi]
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effect of marine algae supplementation
      alone or in combination with a regular mineral supplement (rumen boluses) to
      improve the mineral status in organic dairy cattle and their effect on the milk
      mineral composition, milk production, composition (% of fat and protein) and
      quality (SCC). Thirty-two Holstein Friesian lactating cows were randomly selected
      and assigned to the algae (A), boluses (B), algae+boluses (AB) and control group 
      (C). For the algae groups (A, AB), a supplement composed of Sea Lettuce (80%),
      Japanese Wireweed (17.5%) and Furbelows (2.5%) was formulated to be given to the 
      cows at the rate of 100 g/animal per day (A1) for the length of 4 weeks. In the
      second half of the experiment (weeks 5-8), the algae mixture was reformulated and
      the proportion of Furbelows was increased from 2.5% to 5.0% with a subsequent
      decrease of Lettuce to 77.5% (A2). In the boluses group (B), each cow received 2 
      boluses after calving. Blood (serum) and milk samples were collected at 2 and 4
      week intervals, respectively, and analysed for trace element concentrations by
      ICP-MS. Information related to the milk composition and SCC during a 305-day
      lactation for each animal were obtained from the Dairy Records Management System.
      The supplementation with algae, boluses or the combination of both treatments
      showed a statistically significant effect on the iodine (algae), selenium
      (boluses) and cobalt (algae+boluses) status of the animals. In milk, treatments
      had a statistical significant increase on iodine, and a tendency to increase
      selenium concentrations. The assayed algae mixture combined with another source
      of selenium could be an effective tool to improve the mineral status in serum and
      milk.

TI  - Impact of cage stocking density on egg laying characteristics and related stress 
      and immunity parameters of Japanese quails in subtropics.
PG  - 893-901

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different cage stocking
      densities on egg production parameters, as well as related stress and immunity
      indices in Japanese quails under subtropical Egyptian conditions. Two hundred and
      sixteen birds of Japanese quail at 14th week of age were used in this experiment.
      The birds were divided randomly into three groups: 60, 72 and 84. Each group
      subdivided into 4 replicates, where the cages' floor spaces were 200 (S1 ), 167
      (S2 ) and 143 (S3 ) cm(2) /bird, respectively. Birds housed at 200 cm(2) /bird
      (S1 ) had superior fertility (fertility % (p = 0.013) and hatchability % (p =
      0.041)), egg production (egg weight (p = 0.034) and egg mass (p = 0.001)) and
      immunity parameters (higher geometric mean of antibody titres against Newcastle
      disease virus, p = 0.024). Furthermore, they had higher internal egg quality
      score: albumen height (p = 0.003), yolk height (p = 0.023), yolk index (p =
      0.006) and Haugh unit (p = 0.035). Birds housed at 143 cm(2) /bird (S3 ) had the 
      lowest total leucocytic count and lymphocyte % (p = 0.022), but the highest H/L
      ratio (p = 0.001). Corticosterone concentration was lower in S1 group (p = 0.031)
      than that in groups housed at higher densities. Japanese quail housed at high
      densities revealed drop in fertility, hatchability, production and immunity
      parameters, indicating a detrimental effects on both welfare and economic income.

TI  - Enteric methane and carbon dioxide emissions measured using respiration chambers,
      the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique, and a GreenFeed head-chamber system
      from beef heifers fed alfalfa silage at three allowances and four feeding
      frequencies.
PG  - 4326-4337
LID - 10.2527/jas.2016-0646 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine methane (CH) and carbon dioxide (CO)
      emissions from 8 beef heifers (approximately 20 mo of age and 382 +/- 24.3 kg BW)
      measured by respiration chambers and the sulfur hexafluoride (SF) tracer
      technique and a mobile head-chamber, spot-sampling system (GreenFeed; C-Lock
      Inc., Rapid City, SD) when fed alfalfa silage at 3 feeding levels and 4 feeding
      frequencies. Feeding frequency may affect CH yield (g/kg DMI), and measurement
      systems (such as GreenFeed or SF) are needed to obtain accurate estimates of CH
      emissions from individual cattle under grazing where new pasture is provided once
      or twice daily. The Hereford x Friesian heifers were used in 5 consecutive
      periods (P1 to P5) of 14 d with CH and CO emissions measured with the SF
      technique in wk 1 (5-6 d), with chambers in wk 2 (2 d), and with the GreenFeed
      system when not in chambers (8 d) of each period. Alfalfa silage was restricted
      to 6, 8, 8, and 8 kg DM/d in P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively, and provided ad
      libitum (10.9-12.2 kg DM/d) in P5. Silage was fed in 2, 2, 3, and 4 meals per day
      in P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively, and was continuously available (refilled
      twice daily) in P5. Methane production increased from 141 to 265 g/d as DMI
      doubled ( < 0.001), but average CH yields measured in respiration chambers (24.5 
      g/kg DMI) and by the SF technique (22.8 g CH/kg DMI) and the GreenFeed system
      (26.2 g/kg DMI) were unaffected by feeding management ( = 0.6 for chambers and SF
      and = 0.06 for GreenFeed). The CH yields estimated by the GreenFeed system did
      not differ from CH yields estimated by the chambers in P1, P2, P3, and P5 but
      were greater ( < 0.02) than CH yields estimated by the SF technique in P2, P3,
      P4, and P5. Yields of CO (g/kg DMI) decreased with increasing DMI ( < 0.04) and
      CO production (g/d) increased from 5,293 to 9,167 g/d as DMI increased ( <
      0.001). In general, the SF technique and the GreenFeed system provided means for 
      CH yield that were not different from those of respiration chambers, and CH
      yields (g/kg DMI) were unaffected by DMI level or feeding frequency.

TI  - Comparing human respiratory adverse effects after acute exposure to particulate
      matter in conventional and particle-reduced swine building environments.
PG  - 648-55
LID - 10.1136/oemed-2015-103522 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate innate immunity responses, lung function and symptoms in 
      volunteers acutely exposed to organic dust in swine buildings after installing
      particle separators aimed to reduce particulate matter exposure. METHODS: 11
      healthy participants were exposed in 2 different facilities, with and without
      installed particle separators, in a cross-over design including 2-3 weeks
      wash-out between the 2 exposures. Size, distribution and composition of
      particulate matter and endotoxins in the air were measured. Lung function
      (spirometry), bronchial responsiveness, symptoms questionnaire and markers of
      innate immunity in blood and nasal lavage were measured before and after the
      3-hour exposures. RESULTS: The number of particles, in particular fine particles 
      sized 0.3-0.5 microm, was reduced in the particle-separated swine building
      environment (PSE) compared with that in the conventional building (CE). In the
      PSE, headache (p=0.03) and increased body temperature (p=0.016) were less
      pronounced than in the CE. The expression of toll-like receptors (TLR)2 and TLR4 
      on blood monocytes significantly increased (p=0.016 and 0.017, respectively)
      while cluster of differentiation (CD)14 on neutrophils decreased (p=0.05) after
      exposure in the CE, yet with no difference between the 2 exposures. Compared with
      the conventional environment, exposure to the PSE yielded lower interleukin
      (IL)-6 (p=0.02) and IL-8 (p=0.04) levels in the upper respiratory tract, as
      assessed by nasal lavage. CONCLUSIONS: Particulate matter and organic dust in the
      swine building were reduced after installing particle separators, which, in naive
      never exposed volunteers, in turn reduced adverse health effects caused by acute 
      exposure in swine buildings compared with exposure to the conventional swine
      building environment.

AB  - Five primiparous cows (Friesians crossed with undefined breeds and in early
      lactation) were used to assess the milk yield response of dairy cows offered a
      basal feed of Panicum maximum hay and supplemented with diets based on sorghum
      stover and Tithonia diversifolia leaf hay during the dry season. The cows were
      assigned to five experimental diets in a 5 x 5 Latin square design of 21-day
      experimental periods. The experimental diets consisted of a control (Panicum hay 
      alone), and four experimental diets whereby Panicum hay was supplemented with
      diets based on sorghum stover, Tithonia leaf hay, maize bran, sunflower cake, and
      sugar cane molasses as follows: stover/Tithonia/bran/molasses (STBM),
      stover/Tithonia/bran (STB), stover/Tithonia/bran/cake (STBC), and
      stover/bran/cake (SBC). The supplements were formulated and offered to meet the
      crude protein and energy recommendations of a 350-kg cow producing about 10 kg
      milk/day. Average milk yield significantly increased (P < 0.05) from 6.49
      kg/cow/day (control) to 7.25, 7.29, 7.50, and 7.52 kg/cow/day (SBC, STBM, STB,
      and STBC, respectively). There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the
      amounts consumed across the supplements. A similar trend was observed for milk
      returned/kg supplement consumed. On average, each kilogram of STB, STBC, STBM,
      and SBC returned 0.48, 0.37, 0.29, and 0.29 kg milk/day, respectively. Thus, the 
      results of the present study revealed that supplements based on sorghum stover
      and Tithonia leaf hay are a viable option as dry season feed supplements for
      dairy cows. However, only two supplements, namely STB and STBC, had positive net 
      financial benefits.

AB  - Anthelmintic resistance (AR) status in Madras Red sheep from selected field
      flocks of a government funded scheme, covered by regular, sustained anthelmintic 
      treatment for more than 10 years was determined. Parameters such as fecal egg
      count reduction test (FECRT), larval paralysis assay (LPA), and
      allele-specific-PCR (AS-PCR) were used to test the efficacy of fenbendazole,
      tetramisole, and ivermectin at recommended doses, in two seasons. Sheep belonging
      to non-beneficiary farmers were used as controls. Mean FECRT values of
      beneficiary group during winter and summer seasons were 77.77 and 76.04, 93.65
      and 92.12, and 95.37 and 98.06 %, respectively, for fenbendazole, tetramisole,
      and ivermectin. In the non-beneficiary groups, the corresponding values were
      74.82 and 81.09 %, 96.05 and 97.40 %, and 97.26 and 98.23 %, respectively. The
      results revealed resistance to fenbendazole, suspect resistance to tetramisole
      and susceptibility to ivermectin in beneficiary flock. In non-beneficiary flock, 
      while resistance was noticed against fenbendazole, both tetramisole and
      ivermectin were effective. FECR values were found to be significantly different
      between beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups against tetramisole. The results
      of LPA confirmed this finding, as 50 % of the Haemonchus contortus larvae were
      paralyzed at the concentration of 0.0156 mug/ml in the beneficiary group, while
      those of non-beneficiary groups required lower concentrations of 0.0078 mug/ml.
      AS-PCR revealed the predominance of heterozygous susceptible population of H.
      contortus in the beneficiary group. In this study, resistance to fenbendazole was
      confirmed in both the beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups and this could be
      attributed to frequent use of benzimidazoles as seen from the deworming records. 
      Emergence of tetramisole resistance was detected in the beneficiary group, where 
      the drug was used continuously for 4 years. Ivermectin was found to be effective 
      in all the flocks. It is recommended that the practice of routine deworming of
      three to four times a year should be avoided, as it can lead to emergence of
      anthelmintic resistance.

TI  - Supplementation of Flemingia macrophylla and cassava foliage as a rumen enhancer 
      on fermentation efficiency and estimated methane production in dairy steers.
PG  - 1449-54
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1115-5 [doi]
AB  - Four rumen-fistulated dairy steers, 3 years old with 180 +/- 15 kg body weight
      (BW), were randomly assigned according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design to
      investigate on the effect of Flemingia macrophylla hay meal (FMH) and cassava hay
      meal (CH) supplementation on rumen fermentation efficiency and estimated methane 
      production. The treatments were as follows: T1 = non-supplement, T2 = CH
      supplementation at 150 g/head/day, T3 = FMH supplementation at 150 g/head/day,
      and T4 = CH + FMH supplementation at 75 and 75 g/head/day. All steers were fed
      rice straw ad libitum and concentrate was offered at 0.5 % of BW. Results
      revealed that supplementation of CH and/or FMH did not affect on feed intake (P >
      0.05) while digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber were
      increased especially in steers receiving FMH and CH+FMH (P < 0.05). Ruminal pH,
      temperature, and blood urea nitrogen were similar among treatments while ammonia 
      nitrogen was increased in all supplemented groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore,
      propionic acid (C3) was increased while acetic acid (C2), C2:C3 ratio, and
      estimated methane production were decreased by dietary treatments. Protozoa and
      fungi population were not affected by dietary supplement while viable bacteria
      count increased in steers receiving FMH. Supplementation of FMH and/or FMH+CH
      increased microbial crude protein and efficiency of microbial nitrogen supply.
      This study concluded FMH (150 g/head/day) and/or CH+FMH (75 and 75 g/head/day)
      supplementation could be used as a rumen enhancer for increasing nutrient
      digestibility, rumen fermentation efficiency, and microbial protein synthesis
      while decreasing estimated methane production without adverse effect on voluntary
      feed intake of dairy steers fed rice straw.

TI  - Effect of partial replacement of alfalfa hay with Moringa species leaves on milk 
      yield and composition of Najdi ewes.
PG  - 1427-33
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1111-9 [doi]
AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate changes in milk yield and
      composition of Najdi ewes fed 25 % Moringa oleifera (MOD) or Moringa peregrina
      (MPD) leaf diets as a supplement to alfalfa hay diet (AHD). Thirty ewes (average 
      55 kg, 2 years old) were randomly sorted into three experimental groups with 10
      animals each and were fed for a 6-week period with these diets (AHD, MOD, or
      MPD). Diets dry matter, crude protein, and crude fiber were comparable, while
      fat, nitrogen-free extract (NFE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent
      fiber (ADF), metabolizable energy (ME), total phenolic, and antioxidant activity 
      varied (p </= 0.05) between the diets. Feeding ewes with MOD increased (p </=
      0.05) the milk yield compared to those fed AHD while milk composition was similar
      (p </= 0.05) between treatments. The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in
      the ewes' milk and serum was lower (p </= 0.05) for MOD, while the total
      antioxidant capacity, catalase activity, and vitamin C contents were increased (p
      </= 0.05). The serum cholesterol and glucose of the ewes were lower (p </= 0.05) 
      for those fed MOD. Moringa diets increased (p </= 0.05) average daily weight gain
      of lambs compared to those fed alfalfa diets. The results obtained showed that
      the inclusion of Moringa, especially M. oleifera, in the diet of Najdi ewes can
      improve milk yield and quality.

TI  - Total replacement of corn by mesquite pod meal considering nutritional value,
      performance, feeding behavior, nitrogen balance, and microbial protein synthesis 
      of Holstein-Zebu crossbred dairy steers.
PG  - 1415-20
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1108-4 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present study to assess the effects of mesquite pod addition
      replacing corn (0, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 g/kg in the dry matter basis) on
      nutrient intake, animal performance, feeding behavior, nutrient digestibility,
      nitrogen balance, and microbial protein synthesis. Twenty-five Holstein-Zebu
      crossbred dairy steers at 219 +/- 22 kg initial body weight and 18 months of age 
      were used. The experiment lasted 84 days, divided into three periods of 28 days. 
      A completely randomized design was used, and data were submitted to analysis
      using PROC GLM for analysis of variance and PROC REG for regression analysis
      using the software Statistical Analysis Systems version 9.1. Experimental diets
      were composed of Tifton 85 hay, soybean meal, ground corn, mesquite pod meal, and
      mineral salt. Samples of food offered were collected during the last 3 days of
      each period, and the leftovers were collected daily, with samples bulked per
      week. At the end of each 28-day period, the remaining animals were weighed to
      determine total weight gain and average daily gain. The assessment of behavioral 
      patterns was performed through instantaneous scans in 5-min intervals for three
      consecutive 12-h days. A single urine sample from each animal was collected on
      the last day of each collection period at about 4 h after the first feeding. The 
      replacement of corn by mesquite pod meal did not significantly influence
      treatments regarding nutrients intake, animal performance, and feeding behavior. 
      Retained and consumed nitrogen ratio did not statistically differ between
      replacement levels. Likewise, there were no statistical differences regarding
      microbial protein synthesis and efficiency between replacement levels. Mesquite
      pod meal can be used in Holstein-Zebu crossbred dairy steers' diet with total
      corn replacement.

PG  - 1315-21
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1090-x [doi]
AB  - Ingestive behavior of lambs fed diets consisting of fresh sugarcane with urea,
      bagasse treated with calcium oxide, and urea ammoniated sugarcane bagasse
      supplemented with concentrate mixture in 50:50 ratio were evaluated. For this, 34
      wethers Santa Ines in their growing phase, with an average age of 3.0 +/- 0.6
      months and a mean initial live weight of 17.8+/- 5.2 kg were used. The animals
      were distributed in a completely randomized design and subjected to visual
      observation periods of 5 days, for 24 h a day, during the experimental period.
      Dry matter (DM) intake and intake efficiency of DM were higher (P < 0.05) for
      animals receiving fresh sugarcane with urea. The animals which were fed with
      bagasse treated with calcium oxide had higher (P < 0.05) consumption of neutral
      detergent fiber, longer feeding and chewing time (P < 0.05), and shorter (P <
      0.05) idling time. The time spent on chewing the ruminal bolus did not differ
      from one diet to the other (P > 0.05). Grams of dry matter per ruminated bolus
      were similar among animals fed with fresh sugarcane and ammoniated bagasse (P >
      0.05) but lower (P < 0.05) in animals fed with bagasse treated with calcium
      oxide. Rumination efficiency values, in grams of dry matter per hour, and grams
      of neutral detergent fiber per hour for all three diets were similar (P > 0.05)
      to those found for feeding efficiency. The number of feeding and rumination
      periods was not affected (P > 0.05) by diet. Based on the intake and ingestive
      behavior responses, the fresh sugarcane with urea compared to bagasse treated
      with calcium oxide and ammoniated bagasse was found to be the better alternative 
      feed for use in lamb diets.

AB  - The effect of feeding fermented dried cassava (gathot) on the performances and
      haematological profile of broilers was investigated. There were four dietary
      treatments arranged in a completely randomized design, i.e. control diet and
      diets containing 25, 50 or 100 g/kg gathot. The birds were provided with the
      treatment diets ad libitum from 8 to 35 days of age. Body weight, feed intake and
      feed conversion ratio (FCR) were determined weekly. At day 32, the birds were
      blood sampled, sacrificed and immediately the internal organs and abdominal fat
      were removed and weighed. Feeding gathot at various levels did not affect (P >
      0.05) the growth and FCR, but tended (P = 0.09) to reduce the feed cost per
      kilogramme live weight gain of broilers. The dietary treatments did not cause
      toxicological effect on broilers, indicated by the values of alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) that were not
      different from those in the control diet. Dietary inclusion of gathot lowered
      heterophils to lymphocytes ratio (H/L ratio) (P < 0.05) and albumin to globulin
      ratio (A/G ratio) (P = 0.14) of broilers as compared to the control diet. Total
      triglyceride was lower (P < 0.05) in the serum of broilers fed diets containing 5
      and 10 % of gathot, when compared with that in the control diet. The treatments
      resulted in reduced abdominal fat deposition in broilers. In conclusion, dietary 
      inclusion of gathot at up to 10 % had no negative impact on the growth
      performance of broilers. Feeding gathot has potential to improve the health and
      physiological stress responses as well as reduce body fat deposition in broilers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with the
      beta-adrenoceptor agonists ractopamine hydrochloride and zilpaterol hydrochloride
      on ECG and clinicopathologic variables of finishing beef steers. DESIGN
      Randomized controlled trial. ANIMALS 30 Angus steers. PROCEDURES Steers were
      grouped by body weight and randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 diets for 23 days:
      a diet containing no additive (control diet) or a diet containing ractopamine
      hydrochloride (300 mg/steer/d) or zilpaterol hydrochloride (8.3 mg/kg [3.8 mg/lb]
      of feed on a dry-matter basis), beginning on day 0. Steers were instrumented with
      an ambulatory ECG monitor on days -2, 6, 13, and 23, and continuous recordings
      were obtained for 72, 24, 24, and 96 hours, respectively. At the time of
      instrumentation, blood samples were obtained for CBC and serum biochemical and
      blood lactate analysis. Electrocardiographic recordings were evaluated for mean
      heart rate and arrhythmia rates. RESULTS Steers fed zilpaterol or ractopamine had
      greater mean heart rates than those fed the control diet. Mean heart rates were
      within reference limits for all steers, with the exception of those in the
      ractopamine group on day 14, in which mean heart rate was high. No differences in
      arrhythmia rates were identified among the groups, nor were any differences
      identified when arrhythmias were classified as single, paired, or multiple (> 2) 
      beats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that dietary
      supplementation of cattle with ractopamine or zilpaterol at FDA-approved doses
      had no effect on arrhythmia rates but caused an increase in heart rate that
      remained within reference limits.

TI  - Impact of school-based vegetable garden and physical activity coordinated health 
      interventions on weight status and weight-related behaviors of ethnically
      diverse, low-income students: Study design and baseline data of the Texas, Grow! 
      Eat! Go! (TGEG) cluster-randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 973
LID - 10.1186/s12889-016-3453-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coordinated, multi-component school-based interventions can improve
      health behaviors in children, as well as parents, and impact the weight status of
      students. By leveraging a unique collaboration between Texas AgriLife Extension
      (a federal, state and county funded educational outreach organization) and the
      University of Texas School of Public Health, the Texas Grow! Eat! Go! Study
      (TGEG) modeled the effectiveness of utilizing existing programs and volunteer
      infrastructure to disseminate an enhanced Coordinated School Health program. The 
      five-year TGEG study was developed to assess the independent and combined impact 
      of gardening, nutrition and physical activity intervention(s) on the prevalence
      of healthy eating, physical activity and weight status among low-income
      elementary students. The purpose of this paper is to report on study design,
      baseline characteristics, intervention approaches, data collection and baseline
      data. METHODS: The study design for the TGEG study consisted of a factorial group
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which 28 schools were randomly assigned to
      one of 4 treatment groups: (1) Coordinated Approach to Child Health (CATCH) only 
      (Comparison), (2) CATCH plus school garden intervention [Learn, Grow, Eat & Go!
      (LGEG)], (3) CATCH plus physical activity intervention [Walk Across Texas (WAT)],
      and (4) CATCH plus LGEG plus WAT (Combined). The outcome variables include
      student's weight status, vegetable and sugar sweetened beverage consumption,
      physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Parents were assessed for home
      environmental variables including availability of certain foods, social support
      of student health behaviors, parent engagement and behavior modeling. RESULTS:
      Descriptive data are presented for students (n = 1369) and parents (n = 1206) at 
      baseline. The sample consisted primarily of Hispanic and African American (53 %
      and 18 %, respectively) and low-income (i.e., 78 % eligible for Free and Reduced 
      Price School Meals program and 43 % food insecure) students. On average, students
      did not meet national guidelines for vegetable consumption or physical activity. 
      At baseline, no statistical differences for demographic or key outcome variables 
      among the 4 treatment groups were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The TGEG study targets a
      population of students and parents at high risk of obesity and related chronic
      conditions, utilizing a novel and collaborative approach to program formulation
      and delivery, and a rigorous, randomized study design.

TI  - The effect of the apolipoprotein E genotype on response to personalized dietary
      advice intervention: findings from the Food4Me randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 827-36
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.116.135012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) risk allele (varepsilon4) is associated
      with higher total cholesterol (TC), amplified response to saturated fatty acid
      (SFA) reduction, and increased cardiovascular disease. Although knowledge of gene
      risk may enhance dietary change, it is unclear whether varepsilon4 carriers would
      benefit from gene-based personalized nutrition (PN). OBJECTIVES: The aims of this
      study were to 1) investigate interactions between APOE genotype and habitual
      dietary fat intake and modulations of fat intake on metabolic outcomes; 2)
      determine whether gene-based PN results in greater dietary change than do
      standard dietary advice (level 0) and nongene-based PN (levels 1-2); and 3)
      assess the impact of knowledge of APOE risk (risk: E4+, nonrisk: E4-) on dietary 
      change after gene-based PN (level 3). DESIGN: Individuals (n = 1466) recruited
      into the Food4Me pan-European PN dietary intervention study were randomly
      assigned to 4 treatment arms and genotyped for APOE (rs429358 and rs7412). Diet
      and dried blood spot TC and omega-3 (n-3) index were determined at baseline and
      after a 6-mo intervention. Data were analyzed with the use of adjusted general
      linear models. RESULTS: Significantly higher TC concentrations were observed in
      E4+ participants than in E4- (P < 0.05). Although there were no significant
      differences in APOE response to gene-based PN (E4+ compared with E4-), both
      groups had a greater reduction in SFA (percentage of total energy) intake than at
      level 0 (mean +/- SD: E4+, -0.72% +/- 0.35% compared with -1.95% +/- 0.45%, P =
      0.035; E4-, -0.31% +/- 0.20% compared with -1.68% +/- 0.35%, P = 0.029).
      Gene-based PN was associated with a smaller reduction in SFA intake than in
      nongene-based PN (level 2) for E4- participants (-1.68% +/- 0.35% compared with
      -2.56% +/- 0.27%, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The APOE varepsilon4 allele was
      associated with higher TC. Although gene-based PN targeted to APOE was more
      effective in reducing SFA intake than standard dietary advice, there was no
      difference between APOE "risk" and "nonrisk" groups. Furthermore, disclosure of
      APOE nonrisk may have weakened dietary response to PN. This trial was registered 
      at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01530139.

TI  - Detailed methods of two home-based vegetable gardening intervention trials to
      improve diet, physical activity, and quality of life in two different populations
      of cancer survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors suffer from long-term adverse effects that reduce
      health-related quality of life (QOL) and physical functioning, creating an urgent
      need to develop effective, durable, and disseminable interventions. Harvest for
      Health, a home-based vegetable gardening intervention, holds promise for these
      domains. METHODS: This report describes the methods and recruitment experiences
      from two randomized controlled feasibility trials that employ a
      waitlist-controlled design. Delivered in partnership with Cooperative Extension
      Master Gardeners, this intervention provides one-on-one mentorship of cancer
      survivors in planning and maintaining three seasonal vegetable gardens over
      12months. The primary aim is to determine intervention feasibility and
      acceptability; secondary aims are to explore effects on objective and subjective 
      measures of diet, physical activity and function, and QOL and examine participant
      factors associated with potential effects. One trial is conducted exclusively
      among 82 female breast cancer survivors residing in the Birmingham, AL
      metropolitan area (BBCS); another broadly throughout Alabama among 46 older
      cancer survivors aged >60 (ASCS). RESULTS: Response rates were 32.6% (BBCS) and
      52.3% (ASCS). Both trials exceeded 80% of their accrual target. Leading reasons
      for ineligibility were removal of >10 lymph nodes (lymphedema risk factor), lack 
      of physician approval, and unwillingness to be randomized to the waitlist.
      CONCLUSION: To date, recruitment and implementation of Harvest for Health appears
      feasible. DISCUSSION: Although both studies encountered recruitment challenges,
      lessons learned can inform future larger-scale studies. Vegetable gardening
      interventions are of interest to cancer survivors and may provide opportunities
      to gain life skills leading to improvements in overall health and QOL.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the changes in knowledge of information
      technology (IT) professionals after receiving a nutrition education intervention 
      for a month. The sample comprised of 40 IT professionals (29 males and 11
      females). The sample was drawn from four IT companies of Hyderabad city using
      random sampling techniques. The data on the general information of the subjects
      was collected. The data regarding the commonly accessed sources of nutrition and 
      health information by the subjects was also obtained from the study. The
      intervention study group received nutrition education by distribution of the
      developed CD-ROMs to them followed by interactive sessions. To assess the impact 
      of nutrition education intervention, the knowledge assessment questionnaire (KAQ)
      was developed and administered before and after the education programme. A
      significant improvement in the mean nutritional knowledge scores was observed
      among the total study subjects from 22.30 to 40.55 after the intervention (p <
      0.05). The findings support the importance of providing professionals with
      nutrition knowledge to promote healthy dietary behaviors.Thus, the method of
      e-learning and development of CD-Rom is essential for teaching the educated
      groups on nutrition, physical activity and overall health education to improve
      their health, lifestyle and eating habits.

TI  - Sustained, Low-Intensity Exercise Achieved by a Dynamic Feeding System Decreases 
      Body Fat in Ponies.
PG  - 1732-1738
LID - 10.1111/jvim.14577 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity in horses is increasing in prevalence and can be associated
      with insulin insensitivity and laminitis. Current treatment strategies for
      obesity include dietary restriction and exercise. However, whether exercise alone
      is effective for decreasing body fat is uncertain. HYPOTHESIS: Our hypothesis was
      that twice daily use of a dynamic feeding system for 3 months would induce
      sustained, low-intensity exercise thereby decreasing adiposity and improving
      insulin sensitivity (SI). ANIMALS: Eight, university-owned, mixed-breed, adult
      ponies with body condition scores (BCS) >/=5/9 were used. METHODS: Two treatments
      ("feeder on" or "feeder off") were administered for a 3-month period by a
      randomized, crossover design (n = 4/treatment). An interim equilibration period
      of 6 weeks at pasture separated the 2 study phases. Measurements of body mass
      (body weight, BCS, cresty neck score [CrNS], and morphometry), body fat
      (determined before and after the "feeder on" treatment only), triglycerides, and 
      insulin sensitivity (SI; combined glucose-insulin test) were undertaken before
      and after treatments. RESULTS: The dynamic feeding system induced a 3.7-fold
      increase in the daily distance travelled (n = 6), compared to with a stationary
      feeder, which significantly decreased mean BCS (6.53 +/- 0.94 to 5.38 +/- 1.71), 
      CrNS (2.56 +/- 1.12 to 1.63 +/- 1.06) and body fat (by 4.95%). An improvement in 
      SI did not occur in all ponies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A dynamic
      feeding system can be used to induce sustained (daily), low-intensity exercise
      that promotes weight loss in ponies. However, this exercise may not be sufficient
      to substantially improve SI.

TI  - The effect of different combinations of local anaesthesia, sedative and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on daily growth rates of dairy calves after
      disbudding.
PG  - 282-7
LID - 10.1080/00480169.2016.1196626 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of sedation and local anaesthesia (LA) at disbudding,
      and the addition of meloxicam or ketoprofen treatment, on weight gain in dairy
      calves following disbudding. METHODS: Friesian-Jersey cross calves, from four
      dairy farms, were enrolled when 3-6 weeks old. All calves (n=271) were disbudded 
      by veterinary personnel and randomly assigned to six groups: 136 were disbudded
      without sedation or LA, of which 31 received 20 mg meloxicam S/C and 75 received 
      150 mg ketoprofen I/M. A further 135 were disbudded with sedation (0.25 mg/kg
      xylazine I/M) and LA, of which 30 also received meloxicam and 75 received
      ketoprofen. Calves were weighed 3 days before, and 15 and 30 days after,
      disbudding (Day 0). Daily weight gain was analysed using mixed models and ANOVA. 
      RESULTS: Complete results were obtained from 263 calves. From Day -3 to Day 15,
      the growth rate of calves disbudded without pain relief (0.53 (95% CI=0.47-0.60) 
      kg/day) was less that of calves disbudded with some form of pain relief (0.65
      (95% CI=0.62-0.68) kg/d; p=0.004). There was no difference between the effect of 
      meloxicam or ketoprofen (p=1.00). An interaction between use of sedation and LA
      and additional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) meant that NSAID
      treatment did not increase growth rates in calves disbudded with sedation and LA 
      but did increase growth rates for calves disbudded without pain relief (p<0.05). 
      From Day 16 to Day 30 there was no effect of NSAID treatment on growth rate, but 
      calves receiving LA and sedation grew faster (0.74 (95% CI=0.69-0.80) kg/day)
      than calves disbudded without LA and sedation (0.66 (95% CI=0.61-0.71) kg/day;
      p=0.018). From Day -3 to Day 30, calves disbudded with sedation and LA grew
      faster (0.71 (95%CI=0.64-0.77) kg/day) than calves disbudded without sedation and
      LA (0.60 (95% CI=0.55-0.65) kg/day; p=0.011). However, addition of NSAID to
      sedation and LA made no further difference to growth rates (p=0.69). CONCLUSIONS:
      Dairy calves disbudded with no pain relief had slower growth rates than calves
      receiving pain relief. From Day 15 to 30 calves given no pain relief, or NSAID
      alone, grew more slowly than those receiving sedation and LA at disbudding. The
      addition of NSAID treatment to sedation and LA did not further increase growth
      rates. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study adds to the evidence that pain management
      when disbudding is beneficial for calf productivity as well as calf welfare.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Objective of this study was the improvement of selected parameters of
      udder health by mastitis vaccination in a dairy herd with elevated bulk milk
      somatic cell counts and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus as predominant mastitis
      causing pathogen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On a dairy farm, pregnant heifers (status
      group [SG] 1; n = 181) as well as cows stratified for their udder health state
      (classification based on results of cytobacteriological investigations of quarter
      milk samples obtained before dry cow therapy [MS0]) (SG 2-4; n = 416) were
      randomly assigned to one of the following vaccination groups (VG): Startvac(R)
      (VG SV), Bestvac(R) Rind Mastitis (containing herd-specific S. aureus-strains; VG
      BV) and the unvaccinated control (VG Co, placebo), respectively. The collected
      data (5 [MS5] and 52 [MS52] days in milk [DIM]: quarter milk somatic cell count
      [QSCC] and bacteriological investigation of quarter milk samples; dairy herd
      improvement test [DHIT] days 1-10: milk yield and individual cow somatic cell
      count; until 305 DIM: clinical mastitis cases) were compared between the VG
      within their SG. RESULTS: S. aureus prevalences were significantly lower in VG SV
      (p < 0.001) and VG BV (p = 0.006) within SG 3 and in VG SV (p = 0.008) within SG 
      4, respectively, in comparison to VG Co. Milk yields (DHIT days [p = 0.042] and
      305-day milk yield [p = 0.040]) were significantly less in VG SV within SG 4
      compared to VG Co. Significant different changes over time in comparison to VG Co
      indicating a vaccine effect during lactation were only observed for QSCC within
      SG 4 for VG BV (p = 0.017; increase towards MS52) and for S. aureus prevalence
      within SG 3 for VG BV (p < 0.001; opposing trends from MS0 towards MS52). All
      other interactions of time and VG under investigation were not significant in any
      of the SG. Furthermore, there were no descriptive differences in the incidence of
      clinical mastitis and duration of a necessary mastitis therapy, respectively,
      between the VG within their SG. CONCLUSION: In this field study, the application 
      of two different mastitis vaccines was not an appropriate tool to improve the
      considered parameters of udder health sustainably.

TI  - Consumers' practical understanding of healthy food choices: a fake food
      experiment.
PG  - 559-66
LID - 10.1017/S0007114516002130 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about laypeople's practical understanding of a healthy diet,
      although this is important to successfully promote healthy eating. The present
      study is the first to experimentally examine how consumers define healthy and
      balanced food choices for an entire day compared with normal choices and compared
      with dietary guidelines. We used an extensive fake food buffet (FFB) with 179
      foods commonly consumed in the Swiss diet. The FFB is a validated method to
      investigate food choice behaviour in a well-controlled laboratory setting. People
      from the general population in Switzerland (n 187; 51.9 % females), aged between 
      18 and 65 years, were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the control 
      group, the participants were instructed to serve themselves foods they would eat 
      on a normal day, whereas in the 'healthy' group they were instructed to choose
      foods representing a healthy diet. Participants chose significantly more healthy 
      foods, with 4.5 g more dietary fibre, 2 % more protein and 2 % less SFA in the
      'healthy' group compared with the control group. However, in both experimental
      conditions, participants served themselves foods containing twice as much sugar
      and salt than recommended by dietary guidelines. The results suggest that
      laypeople lack knowledge about the recommended portion sizes and the amounts of
      critical nutrients in processed food, which has important implications for
      communicating dietary guidelines. Furthermore, the energy of the food served was 
      substantially correlated with the energy needs of the participants, demonstrating
      the potential of the fake food buffet method.

TI  - Evaluation of a Theory-Based Intervention Aimed at Improving Coaches'
      Recommendations on Sports Nutrition to Their Athletes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coaches are a major source of nutrition information and influence for
      young athletes. Yet, most coaches do not have training in nutrition to properly
      guide their athletes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an intervention aimed at improving the accuracy of coaches'
      recommendations on sports nutrition. DESIGN: This was a quasi-experimental study 
      with a comparison group and an intervention group. Measurements were made at
      baseline, post-intervention, and after a 2-month follow-up period. Coaches'
      recommendations on sports nutrition during the follow-up period were recorded in 
      a diary. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: High school coaches from various sports (n=41)
      were randomly assigned to a comparison group or an intervention group.
      INTERVENTION: Both groups attended two 90-minute sessions of a theory-based
      intervention targeting determinants of coaches' intention to provide
      recommendations on sports nutrition. The intervention group further received an
      algorithm that summarizes sports nutrition guidelines to help promote decision
      making on sports nutrition recommendations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nutrition
      knowledge and accuracy of coaches' recommendations on sports nutrition.
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: chi(2) analyses and t-tests were used to compare 
      baseline characteristics; mixed and general linear model analyses were used to
      assess the change in response to the intervention and differences in behaviors,
      respectively. RESULTS: Coaches in the intervention vs comparison group provided
      more nutrition recommendations during the 2-month post-intervention period (mean 
      number of recommendations per coach 25.7+/-22.0 vs 9.4+/-6.5, respectively;
      P=0.004) and recommendations had a greater accuracy (mean number of accurate
      recommendations per coach 22.4+/-19.9 [87.1%] vs 4.3+/-3.2 [46.1%], respectively;
      P<0.001). Knowledge was significantly increased post-intervention in both groups,
      but was maintained only in the intervention group during the 2-month follow-up
      (Pgroup*time=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A theory-based intervention combined with a
      decision-making algorithm maintained coaches' sports nutrition knowledge level
      over time and helped them to provide more accurate recommendations on sports
      nutrition.

TI  - Antibacterial efficacy and pharmacokinetic evaluation of sanguinarine in common
      carp (Cyprinus carpio) following a single intraperitoneal administration.
PG  - 993-1000
LID - 10.1111/jfd.12433 [doi]
AB  - Sanguinarine (SA), with antimicrobial and antiparasitic activities against fish
      pathogens, exhibits great potential commercial use in aquaculture. However,
      little information on pharmacokinetics of SA restricts further application in
      aquaculture. In this study, pharmacokinetics of SA in common carp (Cyprinus
      carpio) following a single intraperitoneal administration [10 mg kg(-1) BW (body 
      weight)] was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The peak
      concentration (Cmax ) of SA in kidney was 11.8 mug g(-1) , which was higher than 
      in other tissues and plasma. The terminal half-life in fish tissue and plasma was
      as follows: 42.3 h (kidney) > 37.2 h (liver) > 20.1 h (gill) > 18.8 h (muscle) > 
      10.9 h (spleen) > 10.0 h (plasma). Additionally, we determined the bacterial
      loads in tissues of common carp infected with Aeromonas hydrophila after i.p.
      administration of SA at 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) BW. The results showed that
      i.p. administration of SA at 10 mg kg(-1) BW significantly enhanced antibacterial
      efficacy against A. hydrophila, where the antibacterial ratio in the gill,
      kidney, spleen and liver on day 5 was 95.13%, 93.33%, 90.09% and 92.82%,
      respectively. Overall, these results suggested the potential of SA to treat A.
      hydrophila infection in common carp farming industry.

TI  - Women's and children's acceptance of biofortified quality protein maize for
      complementary feeding in rural Ethiopia.
PG  - 3439-45
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.7526 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For impact of nutritionally improved biofortified crops, consumer
      acceptance specifically by women and children is necessary when the target
      beneficiaries are young children. The objective was to assess women's and
      children's acceptance of a biofortified crop, quality protein maize (QPM), for
      complementary feeding in rural Ethiopia. RESULTS: Randomly sampled mothers (n =
      61) of young children (6-24 months) evaluated flours from a QPM and a
      conventional maize variety for five sensory characteristics and overall
      acceptance by mother and child in a home use test with a double-blind, randomized
      controlled cross-over design. Women distinguished the varieties when used to
      prepare porridge, and QPM scored more favorably for texture in hand and mouth
      (both P < 0.05). The varieties did not differ in overall acceptance, which was,
      however, affected by order of presentation, mothers' number of children, and
      enumerators who collected data (all P < 0.05). Aroma and taste were key in
      mothers' acceptance, and appearance was further important for children. Women
      were more than twice as likely to prefer QPM over conventional maize. CONCLUSION:
      Consumer acceptance is unlikely to impede uptake and impact of QPM on young
      children's nutritional status. Home use testing proved feasible for assessing
      acceptance in rural areas with food insecurity and limited education. (c) 2015

TI  - Effects of genotype and stocking density on broiler performance under three
      feeding regimes.
PG  - 1227-34
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1080-z [doi]
AB  - Ross 308 and Cobb Avian 48 broilers were used in a 49-day study. The effects of
      genotype, stocking density, and limited-time feeding on growth performance and
      carcass characteristics were investigated. Overall, Ross consumed more feed,
      gained more body weight, and was heavier at marketing age than Cobb. Ross also
      had a higher drumstick percentage, but the percentages of the other carcass parts
      were similar in the two genotypes. Birds reared at the stocking density of 30 kg 
      BW/m(2) gained more body weight and were heavier at marketing than those raised
      at 40 kg BW/m(2), but both groups consumed similar quantities of feed and had
      similar carcass percentages. Neither genotype nor stocking density influenced
      feed conversion ratio and mortality rate, but genotype x stocking density
      interaction significantly affected feed consumption and mortality rate. The
      feed-restricted birds consumed less feed, gained less weight, were lighter at
      market age, and had lower percentages of breast, neck, and heart than the
      full-fed birds. Feed restriction also significantly lowered mortality rate but
      had insignificant effects on feed conversion ratio and percentages of carcass,
      breast, back, drumstick, neck, wing, gizzard, heart, liver, and abdominal fat.
      For profitable poultry production in the tropics and subtropics, it is
      recommended that Ross 308 raised at the stocking density of 30 kg BW/m(2) and
      subjected to 10-h daily feed removal from 7 to 35 days of age in a 49-day
      production period be considered.

TI  - Does supplementation of beef calves by creep feeding systems influence milk
      production and body condition of the dams?
PG  - 1241-6
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1083-9 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of beef calves' supplementation
      in creep feeding systems on milk yield, body weight (BW), and body condition
      score (BCS) of their dams on tropical pastures using a meta-analytical approach. 
      The database was obtained from 11 experiments conducted between 2009 and 2014 in 
      Brazil, totaling 485 observations (cows). The database consisted of 273 Nellore
      and 212 crossbred (7/8 Nellore x 1/8 Holstein) cows. All experiments were carried
      out in the suckling phase (from 3 to 8 months of age of calves) during the
      transition phase between rainy and dry seasons from February to June of different
      years. The data were analyzed by a meta-analytical approach using mixed models
      and taking into account random variation among experiments. Calves'
      supplementation (P >/= 0.59) and the calves' sex (P >/= 0.48) did not affect milk
      yield of cows. The average fat-corrected milk (FCM) yield was 6.71 and 6.83
      kg/day for cows that had their calves supplemented and not supplemented,
      respectively. Differences were observed (P < 0.0001) for milk yield due to the
      genetic group where crossbred cows presented greater FCM yield (7.37 kg/day)
      compared with Nellore cows (6.17 kg/day). There was no effect of the calves'
      supplementation on BW change (P >/= 0.11) and BCS change (P >/= 0.23) of the
      cows. Therefore, it is concluded that supplementation of beef calves using creep 
      feeding systems in tropical pastures does not affect milk yield, body weight, or 
      body condition of their dams.

TI  - Nutritive value of three tropical forage legumes and their influence on growth
      performance, carcass traits and organ weights of pigs.
PG  - 1165-73
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1070-1 [doi]
AB  - The effects of tropical forage legumes on feed intake, growth performance and
      carcass traits were investigated in 16 groups of two Large White x Duroc pigs.
      The diets consisted of a commercial corn-soybean meal diet as the basal diet and 
      three forage-supplemented diets. Four groups of control pigs received daily 4 %
      of body weight of the basal diet, and 12 groups of experimental pigs were fed the
      basal diet at 3.2 % of body weight completed with fresh leaves of one of the
      three forage legumes (Psophocarpus scandens, Stylosanthes guianensis and Vigna
      unguiculata) ad libitum. The study lasted 90 days. The in vitro digestion and
      fermentation of the forage legumes were also determined. The in vitro digestible 
      energy content of the legumes was between 0.72 and 0.77 that of the basal diet
      (14.4 MJ/kg dry matter (DM)). V . unguiculata was the most digestible forage
      legume expected for crude protein digestibility. Feeding forage legumes lowered
      the dry matter intake by 4.5 to 9.6 % (P < 0.05), final body weight (P = 0.013), 
      slaughter weight, average daily gain and hot carcass weight (P < 0.05) without
      affecting the feed conversion ratio (FCR), dressing percentage and back fat
      thickness. In conclusion, using forage to feed pig could be interesting in pig
      smallholder production with limited access to concentrate, as FCR was not
      significantly affected.

TI  - Effect of feeding restriction on growth and dressing percentages in Mexican
      hairless pig.
PG  - 1157-63
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1069-7 [doi]
AB  - Twenty-four male Mexican hairless pigs, weighing 16 +/- 1.12 kg, were used to
      evaluate growth performance and carcass yield in pigs fed 2 (L), 3 (M) and 4 (H) 
      times the Metabolizable Energy (ME) required for maintenance. The pigs were
      assigned randomly to two experimental rearing systems (indoors and outdoors).
      They were fed daily according to their respective feeding regimen (FR). The
      indoor pigs were fed ad libitum with chopped star grass forage (Cynodon
      nlemfuensis). The outdoor pigs had access during 16 h to a paddock of star grass.
      The pigs were slaughtered when they achieve 70 kg of live weight. No significant 
      differences between indoors and outdoors were observed in any of the variables
      evaluated (P > 0.05). A significant reduction of daily live weight gain (P <
      0.05) was observed conforming to FR reductions (0.501, 0.438 and 0.300 kg/day for
      H, M and L, respectively). Days to achieve 70 kg of live weight increase (P <
      0.05) as FR reduces (110, 124 and 180 days for H, M and L, respectively) were
      recorded. Forage consumption in pigs reared indoors reduces (P < 0.05) conforming
      to FR increases (0.092, 0.121 and 0.307 kg DM/day for H, M and L respectively).
      Fat carcass yield reduces significantly (P < 0.05) according FR reductions (24.5,
      22.8 y 18.9 kg, for H, M and L respectively). Also, carcass meat yield was higher
      (P < 0.05) in pigs from L regimen (25.0 kg) than in pigs from M and H regimen
      (22.0 and 22.8 kg, respectively). Results obtained indicate a reduction in daily 
      live weight gain conforming to daily feed intake reductions; however, improvement
      in carcass meat yield, accompanied with a reduction in carcass fat yield, was
      observed.

      Mexico.
PG  - 1129-34
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1063-0 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the effects of the inclusion of oat-ryegrass silage
      (ORGS) in combination with maize silage (MSLG) in four treatments: T1 = 100 %
      ORGS, T2 = 67 % ORGS/33 % MSLG, T3 = 67 % ORGS/33 % MSLG, and T4 = 100 % MSLG to 
      milking cows on continuous grazing with 4.7 kg DM of commercial dairy concentrate
      18 % CP. Daily milk yield and composition, live weight, body condition score, and
      chemical composition of feeds were recorded during the last 4 days of the
      experimental periods. Feeding costs were calculated by partial budgets. Eight
      Holstein lactating cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square, with 14-day
      periods. There were no statistical differences (P > 0.05) for milk yield (mean
      15.5 +/- 5.0 kg/day/cow) or composition (mean milk fat 34.6 +/- 4.4 g/kg, protein
      32.4 +/- 3.1 g/kg, lactose 46.9 +/- 1.6 g/kg), milk urea nitrogen (11.3 +/- 2.1
      mg/dl), live weight (434 +/- 38 kg), or body condition score (2.4 +/- 0.15). The 
      silage cost of ORGS was 2.5 times higher than MSLG, so the feeding cost in T1 was
      26 % higher per kilogram of milk than for T4, with T2 and T3 as intermediates.
      ORGS can be a substitute to maize silage in the proportions studied, although
      feeding costs were higher.

TI  - Rumen adaptation of swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) by high level of urea
      supplementation when fed on rice straw-based diet.
PG  - 1135-40

AB  - Four rumen-fistulated swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) were randomly allocated
      to investigate rumen adaptation of urea on feed intake, nutrient digestibility,
      fermentation efficiency, and microbial protein synthesis. Buffaloes were fed with
      rice straw ad libitum for a period of 2 weeks and then were shifted to a step-up 
      diet regimen by supplementation of concentrate containing 20 and 40 g/kg urea at 
      5 g/kg BW for a period of 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. The results revealed that 
      feed intake and nutrient digestibility were increased by urea supplementation (P 
      < 0.05) both at two and four period of consumption. However, ruminal pH,
      temperature, and protozoal population were neither affected by urea nor
      adaptation period (P > 0.05) while bacterial and fungal zoospores were increased 
      especially at 40 g/kg urea. Data from real-time PCR further showed that total
      bacteria and the three predominant cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus,
      Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) were increased by urea
      supplementation both at 2 and 4 weeks of urea feeding. Furthermore, methane
      production was similar among treatments while microbial protein synthesis was
      enhanced when buffaloes were fed with urea after a period of 2 weeks especially
      at 40 g/kg urea (P < 0.05). It can be concluded that urea supplementation could
      increase feed intake, nutrient digestibility, microbial protein synthesis, and
      fermentation efficiency of swamp buffaloes fed on rice straw. It is suggested
      that buffaloes could adapt well and utilize urea as a N source effectively within
      a period of 2 weeks uptake without adverse effect.

TI  - Serological response and protection level evaluation in chickens exposed to
      grains coated with I2 Newcastle disease virus for effective oral vaccination of
      village chickens.
PG  - 150

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional Newcastle disease (ND) vaccination strategies in village
      chicken production settings is impractical due to shortage of cold-chain,
      unsuitability of vaccine administration routes and demanding trained personnel
      and hence affected its adoption. Results from earlier works elsewhere showed that
      the heat stable vaccines such as NDI2 are thought to be promising for village
      chickens. This study investigated the suitability and efficacy of Ethiopian
      cereal grains as carriers for the orally administrated NDI2 vaccine in chickens. 
      RESULTS: Of the 15 treatment groups, drinking water, cracked maize and parboiled 
      barley induced significantly higher HI antibody titer than the other carrier
      grains and naive control. The higher mean HI titer of chickens in drinking-water,
      cracked maize and parboiled barley group resulted in 100 % survival rate. In
      general, there was an inverse relationship between chicken mortality (%) and mean
      HI titer. Chickens with higher HI antibody titers had better survival rate to the
      challenge experiment. Booster vaccination at age of day 35 and 105 induced
      progressively higher HI antibodies titers in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Vaccine coated parboiled grains could be a good carrier followed by cracked
      grains while untreated vaccine carrier grains had lower serological responses and
      protection levels. The current finding gives insights on suitable vaccine
      delivery system in villages with weak health and transportation infrastructure,
      unreliable electricity, and minimally trained health workers without catching
      chickens individually.

TI  - The impact of a multidisciplinary self-care management program on quality of
      life, self-care, adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy, glycemic control, and
      renal function in diabetic kidney disease: A Cross-over Study Protocol.
PG  - 88
LID - 10.1186/s12882-016-0279-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease, a global health issue, remains associated
      with high morbidity and mortality. Previous research has shown that
      multidisciplinary management of chronic disease can improve patient outcomes. The
      effect of multidisciplinary self-care management on quality of life and renal
      function of patients with diabetic kidney disease has not yet been well
      established. METHOD/DESIGN: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a 
      multidisciplinary self-care management program on quality of life, self-care
      behavior, adherence to anti-hypertensive treatment, glycemic control, and renal
      function of adults with diabetic kidney disease. A uniform balanced cross-over
      design is used, with the objective to recruit 40 adult participants with diabetic
      kidney disease, from public and private out-patient settings in French speaking
      Switzerland. Participants are randomized in equal number into four study arms.
      Each participant receives usual care alternating with the multidisciplinary self-
      care management program. Each treatment period lasts three months and is repeated
      twice at different time intervals over 12 months depending on the cross-over arm.
      The multidisciplinary self-care management program is led by an advanced practice
      nurse and adds nursing and dietary consultations and follow-ups, to the habitual 
      management provided by the general practitioner, the nephrologist and the
      diabetologist. Data is collected every three months for 12 months. Quality of
      life is measured using the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life scale,
      patient self-care behavior is assessed using the Revised Summary of Diabetes
      Self-Care Activities, and adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy is evaluated
      using the Medication Events Monitoring System. Blood glucose control is measured 
      by the glycated hemoglobin levels and renal function by serum creatinine,
      estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. Data
      will be analyzed using STATA version 14. DISCUSSION: The cross-over design will
      elucidate the responses of individual participant to each treatment, and will
      allow us to better evaluate the use of such a design in clinical settings and
      behavioral studies. This study also explores the impact of a theory-based nursing
      practice and its implementation into a multidisciplinary context. TRIAL

AB  - The use of ultrasound imaging for the examination of reproductive organs has
      contributed substantially to the fertility management of dairy cows around the
      world. This method has many advantages such as noninvasiveness and immediate
      availability of information. Adding Doppler index to the ultrasound imaging
      examination, improved the estimation of blood volume and flow rate to the ovaries
      in general and to the dominant follicle in particular. The aim of this study was 
      to examine changes in the blood flow to the dominant follicle and compare them to
      the follicular development throughout the cycle. We further set out to examine
      the effects of different types of cooling management during the summer on the
      changes in blood flow to the dominant follicle. For this purpose, 24
      Israeli-Holstein dairy cows, under heat stress, were randomly assigned one of two
      groups: one was exposed to five cooling sessions per day (5CS) and the other to
      eight cooling sessions per day (8CS). Blood flow to the dominant follicle was
      measured daily using Doppler index throughout the estrous cycle. No differences
      in the preovulatory dominant follicle diameter were detected between the two
      cooling management regimens during the cycle. However, the length of the first
      follicular wave was significantly longer, whereas the second follicular wave was 
      nonsignificantly shorter in the 5CS group as compared to the 8CS group. In
      addition, no difference in blood flow was found during the first 18 days of the
      cycle between the two groups. However, from Day 20 until ovulation a higher rate 
      of blood flow was measured in the ovaries of cows cooled 8 times per day as
      compared to the 5CS group. No differences in progesterone levels were noted.
      Finally, the estrous cycle length was shorter in the 8CS group as compared to the
      5CS group. Our data suggest that blood flow to the dominant follicle and estrous 
      cycle length is affected by heat stress. Using the appropriate cooling management
      during heat stress can enhance the blood flow to the ovary and may contribute to 
      improved fertility in dairy cows.

      strategies.
PG  - 3042-50
LID - 10.2527/jas.2016-0392 [doi]
AB  - The feeding behavior of growing-finishing pigs reared under precision feeding
      strategies was studied in 35 barrows and 35 females (average initial BW of 30.4
      +/- 2.2 kg) over 84 d. Five different feeding programs were evaluated, namely a
      conventional 3-phase program in which pigs were fed with a constant blend of diet
      A (high nutrient density) and diet B (low nutrient density) and 4 daily
      phase-feeding programs in which pigs were fed daily with a blend meeting 110,
      100, 90, or 80% of the individual Lys requirements. Electronic feeder systems
      automatically recorded the visits to the feeder, the time of the meals, and the
      amount of feed consumed per meal. The trial lasted 84 d and the database
      contained 59,701 feeder visits. The recorded database was used to calculate the
      number of meals per day, feeding time per meal (min), intervals between meals
      (min), feed intake per meal (g), and feed consumption rate (feed intake divided
      by feeding time per meal, expressed in g/min) of each animal. The feeding pattern
      was predominantly diurnal (73% of the feeder visits). Number of meals, duration
      of meals, time between meals, feed consumed per meal, and feed consumption rate
      were not affected by the feeding programs. The females ingested 19% less feed per
      meal and had a 6% lower feed consumption rate in comparison with the barrows ( < 
      0.05). Pig feeding behavior was not correlated with diet composition. However,
      feed efficiency was negatively correlated with amount of feed consumed per meal (
      = -0.38, < 0.05) and feed consumption rate ( = -0.44, < 0.05). Feed consumption
      rate was also negatively correlated with protein efficiency ( = -0.44, < 0.05).
      Multivariate analysis indicated that feed consumption rate and number of meals
      per day are the variables related most closely to pig production performance
      results. Current results indicate that using precision feeding as an approach to 
      reduce Lys intake does not interfere with the feeding behavior of
      growing-finishing pigs.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if interdisciplinary therapy can
      influence the cardiometabolic and serum free fatty acid profile. The second aim
      was to evaluate if there is an association between serum free fatty acids,
      inflammation and cardiometabolic biomarkers in obese adolescents with and without
      metabolic syndrome submitted to a long-term interdisciplinary therapy. The study 
      involved 108 postpuberty obese adolescents, who were divided according to
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) diagnosis: MetS (n=32) and Non-MetS (n=76). The
      interdisciplinary therapy consisted of a 1-year period of nutrition, psychology, 
      physical exercise and clinical support. After therapy, both groups improved
      metabolic, inflammatory (leptin, adiponectin, leptin/adiponectin ratio,
      adiponectin/leptin ratio and C-reactive protein) and cardiometabolic profile
      (PAI-1 and ICAM). Metabolic syndrome prevalence reduced from 28.70% to 12.96%.
      Both groups reduced myristic acid (C14:0) and increased docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA, C22:6n3), heneicosapentaenoic acid (HPA, C21:5n3) and arachidonic acid
      (C20:4n6). After adjustment for metabolic syndrome and the number of metabolic
      syndrome parameters, multiple regression analysis showed that changes in VCAM and
      PAI-1 were negatively associated with changes in cis-linoleic acid (C18:2n6c).
      Additionally, changes in trans-linoleic acid (C18:2n6t) were also positively
      associated with these biomarkers. Moreover, leptin and leptin/adiponectin ratio
      were negatively associated with changes in docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5n3)
      and stearidonic acid (SDA, C18:4n3). Adiponectin/leptin ratio was positively
      associated with docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5n3). Changes in adiponectin were
      positively correlated with changes in omega 3, such as heneicosapentaenoic acid
      (HPA, C21:5n3) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5n3). Results support that
      interdisciplinary therapy can control inflammatory and cardiometabolic profile in
      obese adolescents. Moreover, serum fatty acids can be influenced by lifestyle
      changes and are able to modulate these biomarkers.

TI  - Minigrants for Community Health: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Their Impact on
      Family Food Gardening.
PG  - 379-86
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0000000000000359 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of minigrants on home food gardening and review
      28 health-related minigrant programs reported in the literature for lessons
      relevant for using minigrant programs to promote community health. DESIGN:
      Randomized controlled trial of the impact of minigrants on square footage of food
      garden area and on garden initiation in 2010 versus 2011. Interviews with
      participants were also conducted and coded and the literature was reviewed for
      findings from other community health minigrant programs. SETTING: Laramie,
      Wyoming. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty adults living in 53 households who attended a
      gardening training workshop in April 2011. INTERVENTION: A $40 minigrant in the
      form of a voucher, valid at a local gardening store. RESULTS: Minigrant
      recipients were more likely to increase their gardening space than the control
      group. The average increase for the intervention group was 39.2 ft (3.62 m) while
      the control group average garden plot size decreased slightly, on average, by 1.4
      ft (-0.13 m). However, the data were not normally distributed and, therefore,
      nonparametric statistical tests were used. For the subset of 20 households that
      did not garden at all in 2010, minigrants also provided motivation to start
      gardening (8 of 10 minigrant households started a garden vs 2 of 10 control
      households). Results reported from other health minigrant programs are also
      positive, though few had quantitative outcomes or control groups for comparison. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Even with very small amounts of money, minigrants show promise as an
      ethical, inexpensive, empowering, and effective health promotion strategy to
      enable families and communities to improve their health.

TI  - Evaluation of a community-based behavioral weight loss program in Chinese adults:
      A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1464-70
LID - 10.1002/oby.21527 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Weight losses between a group of participants assigned to a weight
      loss program based in the community [i.e., specifically the methodology used by
      Weight Watchers (WW)] and a Nutrition Education (NE) control group were compared 
      in this study. METHODS: In this 6-month trial, 300 participants with overweight
      or obesity were recruited from Beijing city, China, and randomly assigned to the 
      WW or NE group. Weight, waist circumference, and biochemical parameters were
      assessed at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: At 6 months, the majority of
      participants (79% for WW; 89% for NE) completed the study. WW participants lost
      significantly more weight than the NE group (-4.2 +/- 5.6 kg vs. -0.6 +/- 3.6
      kg). More WW participants lost 5% or 10% of their starting weight [>/=5%: 52.0%
      of WW participants vs. 11.3% of NE participants (odds ratio 8.15, 95% CI:
      4.43-14.97)]; [>/=10%: 26.0% of WW vs. 3.3% of NE participants (odds ratio 9.39, 
      95% CI: 3.55-24.83)]. In addition, WW participants reduced waist circumference by
      3.9 +/- 6.3 cm, while the NE group increased waist circumference by 0.6 +/- 5.5
      cm. CONCLUSIONS: The WW program was associated with clinically significant weight
      loss, demonstrating its potential value as an intervention strategy, based in the
      community, for the treatment of obesity in China.

TI  - Changes in Physiologic Parameters and Effects of Hooding in Red-tailed Hawks (
      Buteo jamaicensis ) During Manual Restraint.
PG  - 127-32
LID - 10.1647/2015-096 [doi]
AB  - Manual restraint in birds of prey is required for many veterinary and research
      procedures. To investigate the effects of handling stress on physiologic
      parameters in raptorial birds, 8 red-tailed hawks ( Buteo jamaicensis ) were
      manually restrained over a 15-minute period. Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate
      (HR), and cloacal temperature were monitored over time and recorded at defined
      intervals during the experiment. The effect of hooding on physiologic variables
      was also evaluated in a complete crossover design. Both RR and HR decreased
      significantly during the 15-minute restraint period (HR, -80 +/- 101.4 beats/min 
      [bpm], [P < .01]; RR, -17.5 +/- 22.6 breaths/min, [P < .05]). Hooded birds had
      significantly lower HRs and RRs at 15 minutes of restraint (HR: 232.5 +/- 26 bpm,
      [P < .037]; RR: 33.1 +/- 6.7 breaths/min, [P < .05]) compared to birds restrained
      without a hood (HR: 280 +/- 74.1 bpm; RR: 51.5 +/- 28.8 breaths/min). Cloacal
      temperature increased significantly in all manually restrained birds (+2.2 +/-
      0.7 degrees C, [P < .01]), with a comparable increase in hooded and nonhooded
      birds. In this study of the effects of manual restraint on red-tailed hawks,
      hooding versus nonhooding amplified the decrease in HR and RR but had no effect
      on stress-induced hyperthermia.

TI  - Feasibility of a patient-centred nutrition intervention to improve oral intakes
      of patients at risk of pressure ulcer: a pilot randomised control trial.
PG  - 271-80
LID - 10.1111/scs.12239 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Nutrition is important for pressure ulcer prevention. This randomised
      control pilot study assessed the feasibility of conducting a larger trial to test
      the effectiveness of a patient-centred intervention for improving the dietary
      intakes of patients at risk of pressure ulcer in hospital. METHODS: A 3-day
      intervention targeting patients at risk of pressure ulcer was developed, based on
      three main foundations: patient education, patient participation and guided goal 
      setting. The intervention was piloted in three wards in a metropolitan hospital
      in Queensland, Australia. Participants were randomised into control or
      intervention groups and had their oral intakes monitored. A subset of
      intervention patients was interviewed on their perceptions of the intervention.
      Feasibility was tested against three criteria: >/=75% recruitment; >/=80%
      retention; and >/=80% intervention fidelity. Secondary outcomes related to
      effects on energy and protein intakes. RESULTS: Eighty patients participated in
      the study and 66 were included in final analysis. The recruitment rate was 82%,
      retention rate was 88%, and 100% of intervention patients received the
      intervention. Patients viewed the intervention as motivating and met
      significantly more of their estimated energy and protein requirements over time. 
      CONCLUSION: This pilot study indicates that the intervention is feasible and
      acceptable by patients at risk of pressure ulcer. A larger trial is needed to
      confirm the effectiveness of the intervention in the clinical setting.

TI  - Antihelminthic potential of quinacrine and oxyclozanide against gill parasite
      Microcotyle sebastis in black rockfish Sebastes schlegeli.
PG  - 259-63
LID - 10.3354/dao02997 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the treatment potential of quinacrine and
      oxyclozanide against Microcotyle sebastis (Monogenea: Polyopisthocotylea)
      infection in cultured black rockfish Sebastes schlegeli. The oral administration 
      of quinacrine led to a reduction in the mean abundance of M. sebastis infection
      in all quinacrine-treated groups, and the groups of fish administered quinacrine 
      at 50, 100, and 200 mg kg(-1) for 3 consecutive days showed a parasite mean
      abundance that was 50 to 30% lower compared to that of the control group,
      suggesting that quinacrine has a therapeutic potential against M. sebastis.
      Although oxyclozanide showed a very high in vitro killing activity, in oral
      administration experiments, only the groups of fish administered 200 mg kg(-1)
      showed less than 50% mean abundance of M. sebastis compared to the control
      groups, suggesting that the absorption efficiency of orally administered
      oxyclozanide might be low in black rockfish and/or that M. sebastis might be less
      sensitive to orally ingested oxyclozanide. As praziquantel has been the sole
      therapeutic against M. sebastis infection in Korea for a long time, a broadening 
      of available control measures is advisable in order to reduce the possible
      emergence of praziquantel-resistant M. sebastis. In our study, although
      quinacrine and oxyclozanide showed a therapeutic potential against M. sebastis,
      the treatment efficacy was not high enough to replace praziquantel. Thus, after
      investigations on the pathological effects and pharmacodynamics, use of
      quinacrine or oxyclozanide in combination with praziquantel may be considered as 
      a way to prevent praziquantel resistance in M. sebastis.

TI  - Spice MyPlate: Nutrition Education Focusing Upon Spices and Herbs Improved Diet
      Quality and Attitudes Among Urban High School Students.
PG  - 346-56
LID - 10.1177/0890117116646333 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether an experiential nutrition education intervention
      focusing on spices and herbs ("Spice MyPlate") is feasible and improves diet
      quality and healthy eating attitudes among an urban and predominantly
      African-American sample of adolescents more than standard nutrition education
      alone. DESIGN: A nonrandomized controlled trial compared standard nutrition
      education in U.S. Department of Agriculture MyPlate guidelines (control group)
      with standard nutrition education plus adjuvant Spice MyPlate curriculum
      (intervention group). Data were collected at baseline and after 3, 6, and 10
      weeks. SETTING: Study setting was two public high schools in Baltimore, Maryland.
      SUBJECTS: A total of 110 students in grades 9 to 12 participated. INTERVENTION:
      The 6-week school-based intervention conducted during health class focused on
      cooking using spices and herbs to eat healthier diets according to MyPlate.
      MEASURES: Dietary intake reported on 3-day food records and healthy eating
      attitudes questionnaires was analyzed. ANALYSIS: Differences in diet quality and 
      healthy eating attitudes between study groups were estimated by t-tests,
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests, and covariate-adjusted regression models. RESULTS:
      Spice MyPlate was feasible and there were modest but significant improvements (p 
      </= .05) in the Spice MyPlate group compared with control in whole grains (31.2
      g/wk) and protein foods (13.2 ounces per week) intake, and attitudes toward
      eating vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although randomized trials are needed, experiential nutrition education focusing 
      on spices and herbs may help urban and predominantly African-American adolescent 
      populations eat healthier diets.

AB  - This study elucidated the experiences of eighteen Latina adults (mean age = 38.5 
      years) from "Promoviendo una Alimentacion Saludable" Project who received
      nutritional intervention as part of the clinical trial. Half of the participants 
      were first generation immigrants from Mexico (50%), followed by U.S. born with
      16.7%. Remaining nationalities represented were Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala,
      Honduras, Peru, and Venezuela with 33.3% combined. The average duration of living
      in the U.S. was 11.1 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) at baseline was 36.59 
      kg/m(2) (SD = 7.72). Based on the DSM-IV, 28% (n = 5) participants were diagnosed
      with binge-eating disorder, 33% (n = 6) with bulimia nervosa purging type and 39%
      (n = 7) with eating disorder not otherwise specified. Participants received up to
      three nutritional sessions; a bilingual dietitian conducted 97.8% of sessions in 
      Spanish. In total, fifty nutritional sessions were included in the qualitative
      analysis. A three step qualitative analysis was conducted. First, a bilingual
      research team documented each topic discussed by patients and all interventions
      conducted by the dietitian. Second, all topics were classified into specific
      categories and the frequency was documented. Third, a consensus with the
      dietitian was performed to validate the categories identified by the research
      team. Six categories (describing eating patterns, emotional distress, Latino
      culture values, family conflicts associated with disturbed eating behaviors, lack
      of knowledge of healthy eating, and treatment progress) emerged from patients
      across all nutritional sessions. Considering the background of immigration and
      trauma (60%, n = 15) in this sample; the appropriate steps of nutritional
      intervention appear to be: 1) elucidating the connection between food and
      emotional distress, 2) providing psychoeducation of healthy eating patterns using
      the plate method, and 3) developing a meal plan.

AB  - Despite the benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption on weight and decreased
      risk for chronic disease, Americans' intake of fruits and vegetables is well
      below the recommended daily servings. While previous studies have assessed fruit 
      and vegetable consumption and the influence of educational interventions on fruit
      and vegetable intake, no studies to date have examined the effects of nutrition
      education combined with provision of fruits and vegetables on changes in fruit
      and vegetable consumption among overweight and obese adults. The objectives of
      this study were to evaluate fruit and vegetable consumption patterns, including
      intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, provide education about
      benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables, expose participants to different
      varieties of fruits and vegetables, and improve fruit and vegetable consumption. 
      Fifty-four adults (19 men/35 women; 44.7 +/- 12.1 y) were randomly assigned to
      one of three intervention groups. The control group received no intervention, the
      education group attended weekly nutrition lessons focused on benefits of fruit
      and vegetable consumption, and the fruit and vegetable group attended weekly
      nutrition lessons and received one serving of fruits and two servings of
      vegetables per day for 10 weeks. Intake of fruits and vegetables was assessed
      using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires and three-day food records.
      Findings suggested that while the majority of participants failed to consume the 
      recommended number of servings of fruits and vegetables per day, nutrition
      education was helpful in improving the consumption frequency of antioxidant-rich 
      fruits and vegetables among overweight and obese adults.

AB  - Complementary foods (CFs) in Ethiopia are cereal based and adding locally grown
      pulses (legumes) to CF would provide needed nutrients. To assess the effects of
      nutrition education (NEd) using Health Belief Model (HBM) in promoting pulses for
      CF, a 6-month quasi-experimental study was conducted in 160 mother-child pairs.
      Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) questions were given to mothers at
      baseline, midline, and endline, along with anthropometric measurements of
      children. NEd involving discussions and recipe demonstrations was given twice
      monthly for 6 months to the intervention group (n = 80) while control mothers
      received usual education. At baseline, mothers' KAP scores were low at both
      sites; at 3 and 6 months of NEd, mean KAP scores of mothers increased (p < 0.05) 
      compared to the control site. Significant improvements in children's mean weight,
      weight for height, and weight for age occurred in the intervention site only.
      Nutritional status of children improved after providing mothers with pulse-based 
      NEd.

TI  - Effects of amino acids and energy intake during late gestation of high-performing
      gilts and sows on litter and reproductive performance under commercial
      conditions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of AA and energy intake 
      during late gestation on piglet birth weight and reproductive performance of
      high-performing (14.5 total born) gilts and sows housed under commercial
      conditions. At d 90 of gestation, a total of 1,102 females (PIC 1050) were housed
      in pens by parity group (gilts or sows) with approximately 63 gilts and 80 sows
      in each pen, blocked by BW within each pen, and each female was randomly assigned
      to dietary treatments within BW block. Dietary treatments consisted of
      combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA intakes (10.7 or 20.0
      g/d SID Lys and other AA met or exceeded the NRC [2012] recommendations) and 2
      energy intakes (4.50 or 6.75 Mcal/d intake of NE) in a 2 x 2 factorial
      arrangement. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models specified
      to recognize pen as the experimental unit for parity and the individual female as
      the experimental unit for dietary treatments. Results indicate an overall
      positive effect of high energy intake on BW gain during late gestation, although 
      this effect was more manifest under conditions of high, as opposed to low, AA
      intake (interaction, < 0.001). Furthermore, the magnitude of BW gain response to 
      increased energy intake was greater ( < 0.001) for sows compared with gilts. Sows
      fed high energy intake had a reduced probability of piglets born alive ( < 0.004)
      compared with those fed low energy, but no evidence for differences was found in 
      gilts. This can be explained by an increased probability ( = 0.002) of stillborns
      in sows fed high energy intake vs. sows fed low energy intake. There were no
      evidences for differences among dietary treatments in litter birth weight and
      individual piglet birth weight of total piglets born. However, individual born
      alive birth weight was approximately 30 +/- 8.2 g heavier ( = 0.011) for females 
      fed high, as opposed to low, energy intake. Furthermore, piglets born alive were 
      approximately 97 +/- 9.5 g heavier ( < 0.001) for sows than for gilts. Preweaning
      mortality was decreased ( = 0.034) for females fed high AA intake compared with
      females fed low AA intake regardless of energy level. In conclusion, 1) BW gain
      of gilts and sows depended not only on energy but also on AA intake, 2) sows fed 
      increased amount of energy had an increased stillborn rate, and 3) increased
      energy intake during late gestation had a positive effect on individual piglet
      birth weight with no evidence for such an effect for AA intake.

TI  - A 2-Year Integrated Agriculture and Nutrition Program Targeted to Mothers of
      Young Children in Burkina Faso Reduces Underweight among Mothers and Increases
      Their Empowerment: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1109-17
LID - 10.3945/jn.115.224261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence demonstrates the benefits of integrated agriculture
      and nutrition programs for children's health and nutrition outcomes. These
      programs may also improve mothers' nutrition and empowerment outcomes. However,
      evidence from rigorous evaluations is scarce. OBJECTIVE: We examined impacts of
      Helen Keller International's 2-y enhanced-homestead food production (E-HFP)
      program in Burkina Faso on the secondary impact measures of mothers' nutrition
      and empowerment. METHODS: We used a cluster-randomized controlled trial whereby
      55 villages with 1767 mothers of young children were randomly assigned to 3
      groups: 1) control, 2) E-HFP with the behavior change communication (BCC)
      strategy implemented by older women leaders, or 3) E-HFP with BCC implemented by 
      health committee members. Data for the treatment groups were pooled for this
      analysis because no differences were found between the 2 groups in key mothers'
      outcomes. We used difference-in-differences (DID) estimates to assess impacts on 
      mothers' dietary intake, diversity, body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)), prevalence
      of underweight (BMI <18.5), and empowerment. RESULTS: The E-HFP program
      significantly increased mothers' intake of fruit (DID = 15.8 percentage points; P
      = 0.02) and marginally increased their intake of meat/poultry (DID = 7.5
      percentage points; P = 0.08) and dietary diversity (DID = 0.3 points; P = 0.08). 
      The prevalence of underweight was significantly reduced among mothers in
      treatment compared with control villages by 8.7 percentage points (P < 0.01).
      Although the changes in BMI did not differ between mothers in treatment and
      control villages, there was a marginally significant interaction (baseline
      underweight x change in BMI; P-interaction = 0.07), indicating that underweight
      mothers had a greater increase in BMI than did mothers who were not underweight. 
      The E-HFP program also positively affected mothers' overall empowerment score
      (DID = 3.13 points out of 37 possible points; P < 0.01) and 3 components of
      empowerment: meeting with women (DID = 1.21 points out of 5 possible points; P < 
      0.01), purchasing decisions (DID = 0.86 points out of 8 possible points; P =
      0.01), and health care decisions (DID = 0.24 points out of 2 possible points; P =
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Helen Keller International's E-HFP program in Burkina Faso
      substantially improved mothers' nutrition and empowerment outcomes. These
      positive impacts benefit the mothers themselves and may also improve their
      ability to care for their children. This trial was registered at
      clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01825226.

AB  - This study assessed the dynamics of cephalosporin resistant (CR) E. coli
      populations during the life cycle of pigs treated early in life with ceftiofur or
      tulathromycin. The study was conducted at eight conventional pig farms; four for 
      each treatment with ceftiofur or tulathromycin. At each farm, 70 7-day-old
      piglets were divided into two groups: a control group (n = 30) and a treatment
      group (n = 40). Faecal samples were collected on day 0 and on days 2, 7 and 180
      post-treatment. Sows were also sampled on day 0. CR E. coli were selected on
      MacConkey agar with ceftriaxone. On five farms, 7-day-old piglets excreted CR E. 
      coli before treatment associated with the presence of CR E. coli in sows. The
      occurrence of CR E. coli positive animals decreased with increasing piglet age.
      The remaining three farms tested negative for CR E. coli during the study period.
      Results demonstrated great variability in the frequency of CR E. coli positive
      animals between farms, independent of treatment. Treatment with ceftiofur
      resulted in a transitory increase in the counts of CR E. coli after 48 h.
      However, other risk factors including the presence of CR E. coli in sows and
      animal age were more important than antimicrobial treatment. Accordingly,
      intervention strategies targeting sows would likely have a beneficial effect in
      reducing the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in primary pig production.

AB  - Early social and economic deprivation, associated with poor nutrition and
      physical inactivity, may lead to adverse health trajectories. A
      cluster-randomized controlled-trial examining the effect of a school-based
      comprehensive intervention on nutrition knowledge, eating habits, and behaviors
      among low socioeconomic status (LSES) school-aged children was performed. LSES
      school-aged children (4-7 years) and their mothers were recruited from 11
      schools, located in one town. The intervention was implemented on three levels:
      children, mothers, and teachers. The intervention (IArm) included nutrition
      classes for children, mothers, and teachers and physical activity (PA) classes
      for children; the control (CArm) received PA only. Interventions were conducted
      by professional personnel, who were trained during in a two-day session to
      deliver the specific program in schools. Family data were obtained by parental
      interviews. Food knowledge observations, packed lunch records, and anthropometric
      measurements were obtained in school at baseline, six months, and at the end of
      the school year. Of 258 children enrolled, 220 (87.6%) completed the six-month
      program. Only children in the IArm improved their nutrition knowledge and
      eating-habits and increased food variety and fruit and vegetable consumption,
      quality score of packed lunches (p < 0.001 for all), habitual water drinking
      increased (p = 0.02), and decreased sweet-drink consumption (p = 0.05). A
      school-based comprehensive nutrition intervention targeting LSES population
      improved eating habits, nutritional knowledge, and healthier packed lunches.

TI  - Human Exposure to Wastewater-Derived Pharmaceuticals in Fresh Produce: A
      Randomized Controlled Trial Focusing on Carbamazepine.
PG  - 4476-82
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.5b06256 [doi]
AB  - Fresh water scarcity has led to increased use of reclaimed wastewater as an
      alternative and reliable source for crop irrigation. Beyond microbiological
      safety, concerns have been raised regarding contamination of reclaimed wastewater
      by xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on carbamazepine, an
      anticonvulsant drug which is ubiquitously detected in reclaimed wastewater,
      highly persistent in soil, and taken up by crops. In a randomized controlled
      trial we demonstrate that healthy individuals consuming reclaimed
      wastewater-irrigated produce excreted carbamazepine and its metabolites in their 
      urine, while subjects consuming fresh water-irrigated produce excreted
      undetectable or significantly lower levels of carbamazepine. We also report that 
      the carbamazepine metabolite pattern at this low exposure level differed from
      that observed at therapeutic doses. This "proof of concept" study demonstrates
      that human exposure to xenobiotics occurs through ingestion of reclaimed
      wastewater-irrigated produce, providing real world data which could guide risk
      assessments and policy designed to ensure the safe use of wastewater for crop
      irrigation.

AB  - With the aim of evaluating the effect of restricted suckling on the onset of
      follicular dynamics and body condition, multiparous Bos indicus cows were
      distributed in two groups. One group (RS=36) was subjected to a scheme of
      restricted suckling starting at 21 days postpartum. Calves were allowed to suckle
      once per day for a period of two h whilst the control group (C=18) remained with 
      their dams at all times. At calving, body condition score, back fat thickness and
      body weight had similar values (p>0.05) for both groups. By day 85 postpartum
      both groups had recorded losses in body weight. The cows in the continuous group 
      formed a greater (p<0.05) number of follicles of class size <6mm in both periods 
      before and after synchronization. The proportion of cows showing estrus and
      ovulation before 45 days, was not different (p>0.05). The number of cows that
      exhibited estrus after 45 days, was greater (p<0.05) in RS than C group, 72.2%
      and 55.5%, respectively. Same situation (p<0.05) occurred in cows that ovulated, 
      88.8 and 66.7%, for groups RS and C, respectively. The subset in the intensive
      observations showed that the size of the bigger follicle was larger (p<0.05) for 
      RS cows than C cows from 36 h after CIDR withdrawal. At 57 h, the size of the
      biggest follicle recorded was not different between groups (p>0.05). A regime of 
      restricted suckling favors the earlier growth of follicles and the prompt
      restoration of ovarian activity.

AB  - The study was conducted to determine feed intake, digestibility, and body weight 
      (BW) change of Washera sheep fed on desho grass and natural pasture hay as a
      basal diet and supplemented with concentrate mixtures. Twenty-five intact male
      sheeps with body weight of 19.4 +/- 1.89 kg (mean +/- SD) were used in randomized
      complete block design. The dietary treatments were 100% natural pasture hay (NPH)
      (T1), 75% NPH + 25% desho grass hay (DGH) (T2), 50% NPH + 50% DGH (T3), 25% NPH +
      75% DGH (T4), and 100% DGH (T5). Equal amount of concentrate mixture (CM) (300 g 
      DM/day/h) was supplemented in all of the five treatments. The result of
      laboratory chemical analysis revealed that the CP content of the basal diets
      increased with increased proportion of desho grass hay inclusion in the
      treatments at the expense of natural pasture hay. Total DM, OM, CP, NDF, and ADF 
      intake and digestibility was significant (P < 0.05) and in the increasing order
      of T1 < T2 < T3 < T4 < T5. The average daily body weight gain (ADG) of
      experimental sheep was significantly (P < 0.05) higher as proportion of desho
      grass increased from 0 to 100% in the basal diet. The result indicated that desho
      grass can be used as a basal diet for local sheep with better performance than
      natural pasture hay-based diets.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the net requirements of calcium (Ca),
      phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and sulphur (S) for weight gain of non-descript
      breed hair lambs (NDBL) of different sex classes reared under Brazilian semiarid 
      conditions. Sixty NDBL (20 intact males, 20 castrated males, and 20 females),
      with an average initial body weight of 18.1 +/- 0.4 kg and average age of 5
      months were used. The macromineral requirements were determined by the
      differences in body composition through comparative slaughter direct method. The 
      animals were confined for 58 days, and the average fasting body weight (FBW) and 
      average daily gain (ADG) of lambs fed ad libitum were 29.2 +/- 0.6 and 0.19 +/-
      0.01 kg, respectively. The net requirements of macrominerals for gain of NDBL did
      not differ between sex classes (P > 0.05), and ranged from 1.83 to 1.46 g/day of 
      Ca, 1.21 to 1.01 g/day of P, 37 to 30 mg/day of Mg, and 0.31 to 0.28 g/day of S, 
      for lambs with an ADG of 0.200 kg and 15 or 30 kg of FBW, respectively (P <
      0.05). The N to S net ratio reduced and increased, respectively, as the body
      weight and ADG increase. The net requirements of Ca, P, Mg, and S for gain of
      NDBL slaughtered young and at the same age did not differ between sex classes and
      decreased as the body weight increased. The net requirements for gain of Ca and P
      were similar to those recommended by NRC (2007).

AB  - Eighteen intact Red Sokoto male goats (15.4 +/- 0.68 kg BW) were used in a
      completely randomized design to evaluate the inclusion of urea-treated ensiled
      threshed sorghum top (UTST) in their diets. The inclusion rates of UTST were 0,
      350 and 700 g/kg, replacing dried brewers' grains (DBG) by 0 (control) 50 and
      100%, respectively. Intakes of dry matter, organic matter, total carbohydrate,
      hemicellulose, digestible nutrients and energy, nutrient digestibility,
      digestible organic matter fermented in the rumen, digestible organic matter,
      digestible energy/digestible crude protein (DCP) ratio, microbial protein
      synthesis, nitrogen retention and weight gain were lower (P < 0.05; 0.01) in 700 
      g/kg UTST than in 0 and 350 g/kg UTST. Intakes of crude protein, non-fibre
      carbohydrates and DCP, nitrogen balance and volatile fatty acid decreased (P <
      0.01) with increasing level of UTST in the diets, but ruminal pH, NH3-N and total
      nitrogen increased (P < 0.01) with increasing rate of UTST. Feed/gain ratio and
      urinary nitrogen were higher (P < 0.01) for 700 g/kg UTST compared to 0 and 350
      g/kg UTST. A dietary inclusion level of 350 g/kg UTST (replacing 50% of DBG) in
      the diet was the most suitable level for goats under the current experimental
      conditions.

      CH 400 g/head/day + U 0 g/head/day, T2 = CH + U 30 g/head/day, T3 = CH + U 60
      g/head/day, and T4 = CH + U 90 g/head/day, respectively. Results revealed that
      feed intake was not affected while nutrient digestibilities were increased (P <
      0.05) with increasing U level supplementation especially at 90 g/head/day.
      Ruminal pH and temperature were not altered by urea supplementation, whereas
      ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and blood urea nitrogen were increased with urea
      supplement (P < 0.05). In addition, total volatile fatty acid and butyric acid
      were similar among treatments, while propionic acid (C3) was increased by level
      of urea supplement (P < 0.05), but acetic acid (C2) and C2/C3 ratio were
      significantly decreased (P < 0.05). On the other hand, protozoal population and
      methane production were decreased by CH and urea supplement, while bacterial
      population particularly those of proteolytic, cellulolytic, and amylolytic
      bacteria and efficiency of microbial nitrogen synthesis were linearly increased
      (P < 0.05). Based on this experiment, it suggested that supplementation of urea
      and cassava hay for buffaloes fed rice straw improved rumen ecology and increased
      fermentation end products and microbial protein synthesis while reducing
      protozoal populations and methane production. Urea supplements of 60-90
      g/head/day when fed with cassava hay are recommended for swamp buffaloes
      consuming rice straw.

AB  - Fatty acid ethanolamides (FAE), a group of lipid mediators derived from
      long-chain fatty acids (FA), mediate biological activities including activation
      of cannabinoid receptors, stimulation of fat oxidation and regulation of satiety.
      However, how circulating FAE levels are influenced by FA intake in humans remains
      unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the response of
      six major circulating FAE to various dietary oil treatments in a five-period,
      cross-over, randomised, double-blind, clinical study in volunteers with abdominal
      obesity. The treatment oils (60 g/12 552 kJ per d (60 g/3000 kcal per d))
      provided for 30 d were as follows: conventional canola oil, high oleic canola
      oil, high oleic canola oil enriched with DHA, flax/safflower oil blend and
      corn/safflower oil blend. Two SNP associated with FAE degradation and synthesis
      were studied. Post-treatment results showed overall that plasma FAE levels were
      modulated by dietary FA and were positively correlated with corresponding plasma 
      FA levels; minor allele (A) carriers of SNP rs324420 in gene fatty acid amide
      hydrolase produced higher circulating oleoylethanolamide (OEA) (P=0.0209) and
      docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels (P=0.0002). In addition, elevated
      plasma DHEA levels in response to DHA intake tended to be associated with lower
      plasma OEA levels and an increased gynoid fat mass. In summary, data suggest that
      the metabolic and physiological responses to dietary FA may be influenced via
      circulating FAE. Genetic analysis of rs324420 might help identify a
      sub-population that appears to benefit from increased consumption of DHA and
      oleic acid.

TI  - Changes in nutrient composition and in vitro ruminal fermentation of total mixed 
      ration silage stored at different temperatures and periods.
PG  - 1175-80

AB  - BACKGROUND: Total mixed ration (TMR) is widely used for dairy cattle and needs to
      be prepared daily because it deteriorates rapidly. Ensiling TMR allows
      preservation and saves labour at the farm; however, silage fermentation may
      influence various nutritional components. The objectives of this study were to
      evaluate nutritional changes and in vitro rumen fermentation of TMR silage that
      was stored at different temperatures and durations on a laboratory scale in
      comparison with those of typical TMR before ensiling. RESULTS: No distinct
      changes in crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre and non-fibrous
      carbohydrate contents were observed during silage fermentation. However, clear
      changes were observed in the soluble CP and soluble sugar fractions;
      solubilisation of the CP fraction in TMR silage was enhanced by prolonged storage
      and higher storage temperatures, and most soluble sugars were lost during
      ensiling. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the in vitro rumen from TMRs
      before and after ensiling were not significantly different; however, throughout
      incubation, NH3 -N concentrations from TMR silages were significantly higher than
      those from TMR before ensiling. CONCLUSION: A higher ruminal NH3 -N concentration
      from TMR silage may be a result of a shortage of fermentable sugars and enhanced 
      deamination of CP. Feeding TMR ensiled under a high temperature must be
      investigated to balance proteins and carbohydrates for rumen fermentation.

AB  - Goat estrous and ovulatory responses to the "male effect" were characterized to
      determine the time range over which fertile ovulations occur after buck exposure.
      The results were used to explore the efficacy of different hormone-free
      artificial insemination (AI) protocols aimed at diminishing the number of
      inseminations needed to optimize fertility. Adult bucks and does were exposed to 
      artificially long days during winter and then exposed to a natural photoperiod
      before buck exposure (Day 0). Most goats (>70%) ovulated twice, developing a
      short cycle followed by a normal cycle over 13 days after buck exposure. Among
      them, 21% were in estrus at the short cycle and 94% at the normal cycle. This
      second ovulation occurred within 48 hours of Day 6 and was the target for AI
      protocols. In protocol A (n = 79), goats were inseminated 12 hours after estrus
      detection from Day 5 to Day 9. Up to six AI times over 4 days were needed to
      inseminate goats in estrus. Forty-nine percent of the inseminated goats kidded.
      In protocol B (n = 145), estrus detection started on Day 5. The earlier (group 1)
      and later (group 2) buck-marked goats received one single insemination at fixed
      times on Days 6.5 or 7 and 8, respectively; unmarked goats (group 3) were
      inseminated along with group 2. In protocol C (n = 153), goats were inseminated
      twice on Days 6.5 or 7 and 8 without needing to detect estrus. Goats induced to
      ovulate by hormonal treatment were used as the control (n = 319). Fertility was
      lower in protocol B than in protocol C and controls (47% vs. 58% and 65% kidding;
      P </= 0.05), whereas this was higher in buck-marked goats than in unmarked ones
      (64% vs. 33%; P </= 0.05). In protocol B, fertility can increase (>60%) when only
      goats coming into estrus are inseminated. The best kidding rate ( approximately
      70%) was achieved when does were inseminated within 24 hours of the LH surge.
      Protocols involving insemination on Day 7 instead of Day 6.5 led to more goats
      being inseminated during this favorable time.

AB  - Increased cortisol release in parturient cows may either represent a stress
      response or is part of the endocrine changes that initiate calving. Acute stress 
      elicits an increase in heart rate and decrease in heart rate variability (HRV).
      Therefore, we analyzed cortisol concentration, heart rate and HRV variables
      standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval (SDRR) and root mean square of
      successive beat-to-beat intervals (RMSSD) in dairy cows allowed to calve
      spontaneously (SPON, n = 6) or with PGF2alpha-induced preterm parturition (PG, n 
      = 6). We hypothesized that calving is a stressor, but induced parturition is less
      stressful than term calving. Saliva collection for cortisol analysis and
      electrocardiogram recordings for heart rate and HRV analysis were performed from 
      32 hours before to 18.3 +/- 0.7 hours after delivery. Cortisol concentration
      increased in SPON and PG cows, peaked 15 minutes after delivery (P < 0.001) but
      was higher in SPON versus PG cows (P < 0.001) during and within 2 hours after
      calving. Heart rate peaked during the expulsive phase of labor and was higher in 
      SPON than in PG cows (time x group P < 0.01). The standard deviation of
      beat-to-beat interval and RMSSD peaked at the end of the expulsive phase of labor
      (P < 0.001), indicating high vagal activity. Standard deviation of beat-to-beat
      interval (P < 0.01) and RMSSD (P < 0.05) were higher in SPON versus PG cows.
      Based on physiological stress parameters, calving is perceived as stressful but
      expulsion of the calf is associated with a transiently increased vagal tone which
      may enhance uterine contractility.

      dairy cows.

AB  - Resumption of ovulatory activity and the timely lysis of the first CL postpartum 
      (pp) are important determinants for the reproductive performance of dairy cows.
      Cystic ovarian follicles (COFs) and persistent CLs preclude normal ovarian
      cyclicity and increase the calving interval. The objective of this study was to
      investigate the effect of GnRH on the incidence of COFs and the effect of
      PGF2alpha on the incidence of a prolonged luteal phase (PLP) and on fertility
      parameters in dairy cows. A total of 476 cows were examined ultrasonographically 
      for the presence of a dominant follicle (12-25 mm, without CL >10 mm; n = 237) or
      a functional CL (>/=20 mm; n = 239) between 28 and 35 days pp and were allocated 
      to one of four groups. Cows with a dominant follicle received 10-mug GnRH
      (buserelin; group F-T; n = 118) or saline (group F-C; n = 119), and cows with a
      functional CL received 0.5 mg of a PGF2alpha analogue (cloprostenol; group CL-T; 
      n = 119) or saline (group CL-C; n = 120) on the day of initial examination,
      defined as Day 0. Cows were reexamined 7 and 21 days (F-T and F-C) and 3 and 24
      days (CL-T and CL-C) later, and COFs were treated immediately after diagnosis in 
      all cows. On the basis of the ovarian findings on Days 21 and 24, cows were
      treated according to a protocol aimed at timely breeding. The incidence of COFs
      by Days 7 (F-T vs. F-C; 7.6% vs. 16.8%) and 21 (11.0% vs. 21.8%) decreased (P </=
      0.03) with GnRH; however, this did not lead to a substantial improvement of
      calving-to-conception interval (means +/- standard error of the mean; 107.91 +/- 
      5.70 vs. 117.94 +/- 6.63 days), first-service conception rate (42.3% vs. 41.3%), 
      and number of services per conception (2.06 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.31 +/- 0.15).
      Treatment with PGF2alpha decreased (P < 0.0001) the incidence of PLP by Day 24
      (CL-T vs. CL-C; 1.7% vs. 17.5%), decreased calving-to-conception interval(91.28
      +/- 4.77 vs. 101.75 +/- 5.03 days), increased first-service conception rate
      (63.3% vs. 38.7%), and reduced the number of services per conception (1.65 +/-
      0.10 vs. 2.08 +/- 0.12; each P </= 0.01). The results indicate that strategic
      treatment with GnRH or PGF2alpha in week 5 pp to induce early ovulation and
      luteolysis reduces the incidence of COFs and PLP, respectively. Initial treatment
      with PGF2alpha also enhanced reproductive performance when used in conjunction
      with a standardized treatment protocol for all cows in week 8 pp (aimed at timely
      breeding). In contrast, GnRH did not improve fertility parameters of cystic cows 
      in herds where all cows with COFs were treated as expeditiously as possible.

AB  - Horses are seasonal breeders, and robust breeds may exhibit a winter
      hypometabolism when kept under semiferal conditions. In this study, we analyzed
      the effects of artificial long days on rectal temperature, heart rate, heart rate
      variability, hematology, coat changes, semen parameters, and plasma testosterone 
      concentrations in Shetland stallions stabled overnight and assigned to a control 
      group (CON, n = 9) kept under natural photoperiod, and a treatment group exposed 
      to a long-day light program from 15 December to 20 March (AL, n = 9). During the 
      8-month study, rectal temperature, heart rate, and heart rate variability at no
      time differed between groups. Plasma total protein (P < 0.05), hematocrit,
      leukocyte, and lymphocyte counts (P < 0.001) first increased and then decreased
      during the study period but did not differ between groups. Length of the guard
      hair decreased over time (P < 0.001) and this decrease occurred earlier in AL
      than in CON stallions (time x group P < 0.001). Hair regrowth was faster in CON
      than in AL stallions (over time P < 0.001, time x group P < 0.001). Total sperm
      count increased from January to April (AL) and May (CON; P < 0.001) but did not
      differ between groups. Sperm motility and percentage of membrane-intact
      spermatozoa showed no clear seasonal changes and semen parameters did not differ 
      between groups. In conclusion, Shetland stallions showed seasonal variations in
      hair coat and total sperm count but only changes in hair coat but not semen
      parameters were advanced by a long-day light program.

TI  - Complementary school garden, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene
      interventions to improve children's nutrition and health status in Burkina Faso
      and Nepal: a study protocol.
PG  - 244
LID - 10.1186/s12889-016-2910-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and intestinal parasitic infections are common among
      children in Burkina Faso and Nepal. However, specific health-related data in
      school-aged children in these two countries are scarce. In the frame of a larger 
      multi-stakeholder project entitled "Vegetables go to School: Improving Nutrition 
      through Agricultural Diversification" (VgtS), a study has been designed with the 
      objectives to: (i) describe schoolchildren's health status in Burkina Faso and
      Nepal; and to (ii) provide an evidence-base for programme decisions on the
      relevance of complementary school garden, nutrition, water, sanitation and
      hygiene (WASH) interventions. METHODS/DESIGN: The studies will be conducted in
      the Centre Ouest and the Plateau Central regions of Burkina Faso and the Dolakha 
      and Ramechhap districts of Nepal. Data will be collected and combined at the
      level of schools, children and their households. A range of indicators will be
      used to examine nutritional status, intestinal parasitic infections and WASH
      conditions in 24 schools among 1144 children aged 8-14 years at baseline and a
      1-year follow-up. The studies are designed as cluster randomised trials and the
      schools will be assigned to two core study arms: (i) the 'complementary school
      garden, nutrition and WASH intervention' arm; and the (ii) 'control' arm with no 
      interventions. Children will be subjected to parasitological examinations using
      stool and urine samples and to quality-controlled anthropometric and haemoglobin 
      measurements. Drinking water will be assessed for contamination with coliform
      bacteria and faecal streptococci. A questionnaire survey on nutritional and
      health knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) will be administered to children 
      and their caregivers, also assessing socioeconomic, food-security and WASH
      conditions at household level. Focus group and key-informant interviews on
      children's nutrition and hygiene perceptions and behaviours will be conducted
      with their caregivers and school personnel. DISCUSSION: The studies will
      contribute to fill a data gap on school-aged children in Burkina Faso and Nepal. 
      The data collected will also serve to inform the design of school-based
      interventions and will contribute to deepen the understanding of potential
      effects of these interventions to improve schoolchildren's health in
      resource-constrained settings. Key findings will be used to provide guidance for 
      the implementation of health policies at the school level in Burkina Faso and
      Nepal. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN30840 (date assigned: 17 July 2015).

AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of progesterone supplementation during a
      double PGF2alpha injection synchronization protocol on pregnancy per artificial
      insemination (P/AI) and on the incidence of twin births. Seven hundred and eighty
      three dairy cows were synchronized with two injections of PGF2alpha 14 days
      apart, starting on day 35 postpartum for their first postpartum insemination. Six
      days before the second PGF2alpha injection, cows were treated either with a
      progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (PRID-Delta) and an intramuscular
      injection of 500mg of progesterone (n=387) or served as control (n=396) and did
      not receive progesterone treatment. Cows were inseminated 12h after being
      detected in estrus. Pregnancy was diagnosed 40-45 days later by transrectal
      palpation. Progesterone administration improved (P<0.05) the percentage of cows
      detected in estrus in multiparous [(192/255) 75% vs (161/267) 60%], but not in
      primiparous cows [93/132 (70%) vs 90/129 (70%)]. Progesterone treatment increased
      P/AI in multiparous [53/192 (28%) vs 27/161 (17%)] but not in primiparous cows
      [25/93 (27%) vs 29/90 (32%)]. The incidence of twin births tended to be lower
      (P=0.09) in cows treated with progesterone [1/74 (1%)] than in the control group 
      [4/53 (7%)]. It is concluded that progesterone administration during estrus
      synchronization with two PGF2alpha injections in dairy cows improves estral
      response and increases P/AI in multiparous, but not in primiparous cows, and
      tended to decrease the incidence of twin births.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary addition of cinnamon
      oil (CIN), cinnamaldehyde (CDH), or monensin (MON) on enteric methane (CH4)
      emission in dairy cows. Eight multiparous lactating Holstein cows fitted with
      ruminal cannulas were used in a replicated 4x4 Latin square design (28-day
      periods). Cows were fed (ad libitum) a total mixed ration ((TMR); 60 : 40 forage 
      : concentrate ratio, on a dry matter (DM) basis) not supplemented (CTL), or
      supplemented with CIN (50 mg/kg DM intake), CDH (50 mg/kg DM intake), or monensin
      (24 mg/kg of DM intake). Dry matter intake (DMI), nutrient digestibility, N
      retention, and milk performance were measured over 6 consecutive days. Ruminal
      degradability of the basal diet (with no additive) was assessed using in sacco
      incubations (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h). Ruminal fermentation
      characteristics (pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and ammonia (NH3)) and protozoa 
      were determined over 2 days. Enteric CH4 emissions were measured over 6
      consecutive days using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas technique. Adding
      CIN, CDH or MON to the diet had no effects on DMI, N retention, in sacco ruminal 
      degradation and nutrient digestibility of the diet. Ruminal fermentation
      characteristics and protozoa numbers were not modified by including the feed
      additives in the diet. Enteric CH4 emission and CH4 energy losses averaged 491
      g/day and 6.59% of gross energy intake, respectively, and were not affected by
      adding CIN, CDH or MON to the diet. Results of this study indicate that CIN, CDH 
      and MON are not viable CH4 mitigation strategies in dairy cows.

AB  - Enhancing the quality of beef meat is an important goal in terms of improving
      both the nutritional value for the consumer and the commercial value for
      producers. The aim of this work was to study the effects of different vegetable
      oil supplements on growth performance, carcass quality and meat quality in beef
      steers reared under intensive conditions. A total of 240 Blonde D' Aquitaine
      steers (average BW=293.7+/-38.88 kg) were grouped into 24 batches (10
      steers/batch) and were randomly assigned to one of the three dietary treatments
      (eight batches per treatment), each supplemented with either 4% hydrogenated palm
      oil (PALM) or fatty acids (FAs) from olive oil (OLI) or soybean oil (SOY). No
      differences in growth performance or carcass quality were observed. For the meat 
      quality analysis, a steer was randomly selected from each batch and the 6th rib
      on the left half of the carcass was dissected. PALM meat had the highest
      percentage of 16:0 (P<0.05) and the lowest n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFA) ratio (P<0.05), OLI had the highest content of t11-18:1 (P<0.01) and
      c9,t11-18:2 (P<0.05) and SOY showed the lowest value of monounsaturated fatty
      acids (MUFA) (P<0.001), the highest percentage of PUFA (P<0.01) and a lower index
      of atherogenicity (P=0.07) than PALM. No significant differences in the sensory
      characteristics of the meat were noted. However, the results of the principal
      component analysis of meat characteristics enabled meat from those steers that
      consumed fatty acids from olive oil to be differentiated from that of steers that
      consumed soybean oil.

AB  - Physically effective fiber is needed by dairy cattle to prevent ruminal acidosis.
      This study aimed to examine the effects of different sources of physically
      effective fiber on the populations of fibrolytic bacteria and methanogens. Five
      ruminally cannulated Holstein cows were each fed five diets differing in
      physically effective fiber sources over 15 weeks (21 days/period) in a Latin
      Square design: (1) 44.1% corn silage, (2) 34.0% corn silage plus 11.5% alfalfa
      hay, (3) 34.0% corn silage plus 5.1% wheat straw, (4) 36.1% corn silage plus
      10.1% wheat straw, and (5) 34.0% corn silage plus 5.5% corn stover. The impact of
      the physically effective fiber sources on total bacteria and archaea were
      examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Specific real-time PCR
      assays were used to quantify total bacteria, total archaea, the genus
      Butyrivibrio, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus
      flavefaciens and three uncultured rumen bacteria that were identified from
      adhering ruminal fractions in a previous study. No significant differences were
      observed among the different sources of physical effective fiber with respect to 
      the microbial populations quantified. Any of the physically effective fiber
      sources may be fed to dairy cattle without negative impact on the ruminal
      microbial community.

TI  - Glycemic Index of a Novel High-Fiber White Rice Variety Developed in India--A
      Randomized Control Trial Study.
PG  - 164-70
LID - 10.1089/dia.2015.0313 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: White rice, a common Indian staple, has a high glycemic response and 
      is associated with high risk of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to
      compare the Glycemic Index (GI) of a newly developed high-fiber white rice (HFWR)
      with that of commercial white rice (WR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: HFWR was
      developed using biochemical screening approaches and classical plant breeding
      techniques. The GI of HFWR was determined using a validated protocol in 30
      healthy participants in the year 2013 and repeated in a subsample of 15
      participants in the year 2014; the results were compared with the value for WR.
      The incremental area under the curve was calculated geometrically by applying the
      trapezoid rule for both reference food (glucose) and the test foods (HFWR and
      WR). Proximate principles along with dietary fiber, resistant starch, and amylose
      content were analyzed using standardized methods. RESULTS: The dietary fiber
      content of HFWR was fivefold higher (8.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.58 +/- 0.17 g%), resistant
      starch content was 6.5-fold higher (3.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.03 g%) (P < 0.001),
      and amylose content was significantly higher (32.8 +/- 1.1 vs. 26.0 +/- 0.2 g%)
      (P < 0.001), compared with WR. HFWR was found to be of medium GI (61.3 +/- 2.8), 
      whereas WR was of high GI (79.2 +/- 4.8). Overall, HFWR had 23% lower GI compared
      with WR (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The new HFWR variety can be considered as a
      potentially healthier alternative to commercial WR in rice-eating populations, on
      account of its lower GI and high fiber content.

      Corn Milling unit, Cargill Corn Milling, Blair, NE) while increasing corn
      inclusion (SB) and a traditional grain adaptation system decreasing alfalfa hay
      while increasing corn with no Sweet Bran inclusion (CON). Ruminal pH, intake
      characteristics, and 24-h in situ digestibility were evaluated using 8 ruminally 
      fistulated steers (291 kg BW [SD 19]). Steers (4/treatment) were adapted to
      finishing diets across 4 periods consisting of 5, 7, 7, and 7 d and then fed a
      finishing diet for 7 d. No period x adaptation diet interactions were observed ( 
      >/= 0.12). Average ruminal pH decreased ( < 0.01) whereas time and area below a
      pH of 5.6 increased ( </= 0.02) for the SB adaptation system compared with the
      CON adaptation system. Cattle adapted using SB had greater DMI than cattle
      adapted using CON ( < 0.01). As steers were adapted to finishing diets, DMI
      increased ( = 0.01), average ruminal pH decreased ( = 0.05), and time and area
      below a pH of 5.6 increased ( </= 0.04) for both treatments. Ruminal pH for CON
      steers decreased from 6.59 to 6.12 across periods as corn replaced alfalfa hay
      whereas ruminal pH decreased from 6.00 to 5.79 for SB steers. Steers adapted
      using SB had greater ( </= 0.05) in situ digestion of adaptation diets than
      steers adapted using CON for adaptation periods 3, 4, and 5. The SB diets were
      more digestible than the CON diets when incubated in either CON- or SB-fed steers
      for adaptation periods 1 and 2 ( < 0.01). Experiment 2 used 240 finishing steers 
      (273 kg BW [SD 14]) to determine performance impacts of using Sweet Bran instead 
      of forage to adapt cattle to finishing diets. Steers were fed either decreasing
      Sweet Bran inclusion while increasing corn (SB) or decreasing alfalfa hay
      inclusion while increasing corn (CON). Treatments were applied only during grain 
      adaptation (26 d) and all steers were finished on a common diet containing 35%
      Sweet Bran for an additional 147 d. Steers adapted using SB had greater ( </=
      0.01) final BW, ADG, G:F, and HCW compared with steers adapted using CON, even
      though treatments differed only the first 26 d. Grain adaptation treatment had no
      effect ( >/= 0.13) on carcass quality. These results indicate that Sweet Bran can
      be used to adapt cattle to finishing diets instead of forage and improves ADG and
      G:F while decreasing the forage needs of feedlots.

TI  - EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF A MEDETOMIDINE-AZAPERONE-ALFAXALONE COMBINATION IN CAPTIVE
      WHITE-TAILED DEER (ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS).
PG  - 29-37
LID - 10.1638/2015-0121.1 [doi]
AB  - Alfaxalone is a neurosteroid that interacts with gamma-aminobutyric type A
      receptors to produce central nervous system depression and muscle relaxation. The
      effects of alfaxalone vary from sedation to general anesthesia. Alfaxalone is
      synergistic with other tranquilizers and sedatives and therefore has the
      potential to improve existing alpha-2 adrenergic agonist-based combinations used 
      for wildlife immobilization. The objective of this study was to determine the
      efficacy and cardiopulmonary effects of a medetomidine-azaperone-alfaxalone (MAA)
      combination in captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Eight captive 
      white-tailed deer were restrained in a drop-floor chute; hand injected i.m. with 
      0.15 mg/kg medetomidine, 0.2 mg/kg azaperone, and 0.5 mg/kg alfaxalone; and
      released into a small enclosure for observation. The deer were maintained in
      lateral recumbency for a total time from postinjection (PI) of the drug of 60
      min. At 60 min PI, atipamezole was administered i.m. at five times the
      medetomidine dose. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and direct
      systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures were recorded every 5 min.
      Arterial blood samples were taken every 15 min for blood gas analysis. Level of
      sedation and quality of recovery were scored. Statistical analysis was performed 
      using analysis of variance and descriptive statistics with a significance level
      of P < 0.05. Induction (time to lateral recumbency, 7.1 +/- 2.4 min (mean +/- SD)
      and recovery times (time to standing, 9.1 +/- 3.1 min) were comparable to
      currently used medetomidine-based combinations in white-tailed deer. Major
      cardiopulmonary effects observed (values reported are 15 min PI of immobilizing
      drugs) were hypoxemia (PaO2, 54 +/- 9 mm Hg), hypoventilation (PaCO2, 55 +/- 3 mm
      Hg), and mixed acid-base disturbances (pH, 7.22 +/- 0.04). No adverse effects
      were observed after recovery from anesthesia. MAA produced a satisfactory level
      of deep sedation for safe handling and minor procedures in captive white-tailed
      deer.

AB  - We conducted a pilot randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of a
      dietetic intervention to usual care, in 40 individuals with a body mass index
      >30kg/m(2) undergoing total joint replacement (TJR). The dietetic weight loss
      intervention comprised at least four sessions with an Accredited Practising
      Dietitian. At 12 months, the usual care group gained weight, +2.01kg (6.45),
      whereas the treatment group lost weight, -3.38kg (6.62), (p=0.015). Percentage
      weight change in the treatment group was -3.20% (5.24), compared to +1.67% (6.16)
      for the usual care group (p=0.015) and more participants in the intervention
      group (45%) lost >/=5% of their baseline weight (13%), (p=0.057). Physical health
      scores were also better for the intervention group [42.2 (11.80); 32.86 (9.91),
      p=0.014]. Findings suggest that a structured dietitian-led weight loss
      intervention in patients undergoing TJR is more effective in achieving weight
      loss than usual care, and can result in improved physical health scores at 12
      months post-TJR.

AB  - There is limited field-based research and recommendations on the effect of cattle
      feeding management practices on smallholder dairy farms (SDF) for the growing
      dairy industry in Kenya. This controlled trial aimed to determine the effect of
      feeding locally produced dairy meal (DM) on early lactation daily milk production
      (DMP) on Kenyan SDF, controlling for other factors associated with DMP. Privately
      owned, recently calved cows (n=111) were randomly assigned to one of three groups
      of feeding recommendations for DM (meeting predicted DM requirements by: (1)
      100%; (2) 50%; or (3) feeding by the farmer's discretion). DM was provided for
      free to groups 1 and 2 to ensure they had sufficient DM to feed to the
      recommendations. Data collection on cow and farm characteristics occurred
      biweekly for a 60-day period post-calving starting in June 2013. A repeated
      measures multivariable linear regression model was used on the DMP outcome
      variable. With variability in DM consumption within feeding groups due to
      variability in DMP, actual DM fed was assessed as an independent variable rather 
      than assigned feeding groups. DMP was positively associated with each kg/day of
      DM fed (0.53kg/day), cow weight (0.13kg/day), feeding DM in the month prior to
      calving (1.42kg/day), and feeding high protein forage (0.41kg/day), and was
      negatively associated with having mastitis (-0.30kg/day). In interaction terms,
      taller cows had higher DMP than shorter cows, whereas heifers (first parity cows)
      had similar DMP regardless of height. Also, thin cows (2+ parity with body
      condition score<2.5 out of 5) produced less milk (1.0kg/day less) than cows with 
      a better body condition score at calving,whereas thin heifers produced more milk 
      (2.0kg/day more) than heifers in better body condition-this association is
      possibly due to a small unrepresentative sample size of heifers. In conclusion,
      feeding DM in the month prior to calving, improving body condition in cows prior 
      to calving, and enhancing dietary DM and high protein forage were positively
      associated with DMP in early lactation on Kenyan SDF. In addition there was an
      association between, taller cows and increased DMP, evidence supporting the
      importance of educating farmers on good genetic selection and heifer management. 
      These findings will help with future management recommendations for higher DMP on
      SDF.

AB  - Four crossbred dairy cows (50 % Holstein-Friesian x 50 % Thai native), 404 +/-
      50.0 kg of body weight (4 years old) and 90 +/- 5 day in milk with daily milk
      production of 9 +/- 2.0 kg/day, were randomly assigned according to a 4 x 4 Latin
      square design to study the effect of mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) peel powder
      (MSP) supplementation on rumen microorganisms, methane production, and microbial 
      protein synthesis fed concentrate containing yeast fermented cassava chip protein
      (YEFECAP). The treatments were different levels of MSP supplementation at 0, 100,
      200, and 300 g/head/day. Rice straw was used as a roughage source fed ad libitum,
      and concentrate containing YEFECAP at 200 g/kg concentrate was offered
      corresponding to concentrate-to-milk-yield ratio at 1:2. A quantitative real-time
      PCR approach was used to determine the population densities of ruminal
      microorganisms. The results revealed that supplementation of MSP did not affect
      on Fibrobactor succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus (P
      > 0.05). However, total bacteria was linearly increased (P < 0.01) while
      methanogens and protozoal population were linearly decreased (P < 0.01) with
      increasing level of MSP supplementation. Increasing level of MSP supplement could
      decrease rumen methane production from 27.5 to 23.7 mmol/100 ml(3). Furthermore, 
      cows that received MSP at 300 g/head/day had the highest microbial crude protein 
      and efficiency of rumen microbial N synthesis (416.8 g/day and 16.2 g/kg organic 
      matter truly digested in the rumen (OMDR), respectively). In conclusion,
      supplementation of MSP at 300 g/head/day with YEFECAP as a protein source in the 
      concentrate mixture revealed an enhancement of rumen fermentation and methane
      reduction in lactating dairy cows.

TI  - Rice gluten meal as an alternative by-product feed for growing dairy calves.
PG  - 619-24
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1007-8 [doi]
AB  - This experiment aimed at studying the nutritional characteristics and feeding
      value of rice gluten meal (RGM, a wet-milling by-product of rice) in growing
      dairy calves. RGM contained 464 g/kg of crude protein with 821 and 196 g/kg
      nitrogen (N) of borate-phosphate insoluble N and acid detergent insoluble N,
      respectively, which were higher (P < 0.05) than groundnut cake (GNC). In vitro
      gas production, organic matter digestibility and energy values were comparable
      between RGM and GNC. For in vivo trial, 18 Karan-Fries calves (6-12 months) were 
      randomly assigned into three groups based on comparable body weight and age. The 
      first group (GP-I) was fed concentrate mixture containing mainly GNC as protein
      source, whilst it was replaced by RGM up to 50 and 75 % on N basis, in second
      (GP-II) and third (GP-III) groups, respectively. Thus, RGM constituted 140 and
      210 g/kg of concentrate mixture of GP-II and GP-III, respectively. In addition,
      all animals were offered chopped green maize and wheat straw for the whole
      experimental period of 90 days. Results revealed that there was no difference in 
      intake and digestibility of nutrients, N balance, average daily gain (ADG) and
      feed efficiency among three groups. Nevertheless, RGM-based diets produced
      cost-effective ADG than GP-I. Furthermore, experimental calves did not differ in 
      haematological variables like glucose, blood urea N, plasma proteins and
      non-esterified fatty acids. This study demonstrated that RGM could be
      incorporated successfully in the concentrate mixture, replacing 75 % of GNC
      without any discernable compromise in the performance of growing calves.

TI  - Molasses supplementation for dual-purpose cows during the dry season in
      subtropical Mexico.
PG  - 643-8
LID - 10.1007/s11250-016-1012-y [doi]
AB  - The effect of including 9 % of molasses in supplements offered to dual purpose
      cows, during dry season in subtropical Mexico was determined. Forage availability
      in pastures during the dry season is reduced and of low quality. Molasses is a
      readily available source of energy that may improve forage utilization and could 
      have a positive effect on cow's milk production and calves daily weight gain
      (CDWG). Twelve multiparous Brown Swiss cows (409 +/- 33 kg of body weight and 136
      +/- 73 days in milk), and their calves were randomly assigned to two supplements 
      (six cows per treatment). Control supplement (COS) consisted of cracked maize
      ears (CME), soybean meal and urea (14 % CP), and experimental supplement in which
      9 % of CME was replaced by molasses (MOS). Cows received 4.5 kg/cow/day dry
      matter (DM) of supplement. Experiment lasted 10 weeks divided in five
      experimental periods (EP). Animal responses (milk yield, milk composition, body
      weight, body condition score and CDWG) were recorded at the end of every EP. A
      linear mixed model was used to analyse the data as a complete random design. Net 
      profits from milk and beef due to supplements were estimated using partial budget
      approach. Average milk yield was 7 (kg/cow/day) with 30.6, 30.4 and 42.5 (g/kg
      milk) of fat, protein and lactose, respectively. Average cow weight was 422 kg
      and CDWG was 0.8 kg/day. No significant responses on animal production variables 
      were found when 9 % of MOS was included in the supplement; however, total net
      income increased on 4 %, due to higher CDWG.

TI  - Performance, nitrogen balance and microbial efficiency of beef cattle under
      concentrate supplementation strategies in intensive management of a tropical
      pasture.
PG  - 673-81
LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0991-4 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of concentrate
      supplementation strategies on the nutritional characteristics of beef cattle in
      intensive management of tropical pasture. Twenty-four Nellore steer at 250 kg
      body weight (BW) were used, divided into two plots, with 12 animals in each plot.
      The experimental area consisted of 32 paddocks with 0.25 ha of Panicum maximum
      cv. Mombaca. The experiment consisted of 96-day experimental periods, with three 
      periods of 32 days. The strategies studied were P = exclusively on pasture and
      without concentrate supplementation (control), ES = pasture and supplemented with
      a concentrate low in protein, PS = pasture and supplemented with high protein
      content, and PES = pasture and supplementation with balanced protein-energy.
      There was reduced intake of DM in animals of the treatment P in relation to
      supplemented pasture, regardless of supplementation. Animals fed on ES showed an 
      intake of more nutrients than the animals on PS. The CP and TDN were also lower
      in P than in pastures where animals received the additional types of concentrate,
      and the PS animals showed greater digestibility of CP and TDN than the ES
      animals. However, the animals exhibited similar weight gains. Animals on P
      ingested smaller amounts of N and had lower fecal excretion compared to the
      supplemented animals, but there was no difference between treatments in nitrogen 
      balance. Urea nitrogen and urea from the blood were higher in the supplemented
      animals than in animals fed on pasture; these levels were also higher in PS
      animals compared to animals receiving ES. Both the purines absorbed and microbial
      protein production were similar between treatments. However, the animals fed with
      concentrate supplementation, independent of the strategy involved, showed higher 
      microbial efficiency compared to animals fed exclusively on pasture.

      sheep.
PG  - 539-44
LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0988-z [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of replacing Tifton-85 hay (0, 
      20, 40, 60 and 80 % on a dry matter basis) with water hyacinth hay (Eichhornia
      crassipes) on intake and digestibility of nutrients, feeding behaviour, rumen and
      blood parameters of sheep. Five uncastrated male sheep, cannulated in the rumen, 
      with an average body weight of 40 kg were assigned in a 5 x 5 Latin square
      design. The water hyacinth hay contained 870 g/kg dry matter (DM), 159 g/kg crude
      protein (CP), 547 g/kg neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and 461 g/kg total
      digestible nutrients (TDN). The DM intake and digestibility of NDF and non-fibre 
      carbohydrates (NFC) were linearly reduced by replacing the Tifton-85 hay with
      water hyacinth hay. Similarly, there was a linear reduction of rumination time
      and efficiencies of feeding and rumination of DM and NDF. The concentrations of
      urea, glucose, AST and GGT in blood plasma were not changed by replacing the
      Tifton-85 hay with water hyacinth hay. Although water hyacinth hay reduced the
      intake and digestibility of some nutrients, the Tifton-85 hay replacement could
      be economically advantageous for sheep feeding.

      performance, carcass and meat characteristics.
PG  - 517-24
LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0983-4 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two kinds of given diets
      on growth, on some carcass characteristics and on the major meat nutrients of
      local Algerian sheep breed. The investigated sheep breed called "Hamra" is one of
      the most famous breeds in Algeria. Among one 106 animals, 40 lambs were selected 
      according to their age, similar livestock characteristics and body weight. The
      samples were divided into two equal groups: control and experimental lambs
      according to their live weight; 24.63 +/- 0.47 and 24.35 +/- 0.64 kg,
      respectively. Both groups were fed with two varieties of concentrate diets: corn 
      diet based for the first group of control lambs (n = 20) and corn substituted by 
      barley (Variety Saida 183) for the second experimental group lambs (n = 20). Both
      diets were supplemented with 200 g straw of barley/animal/ration. The chemical
      analysis of diets showed an elevated crude fibre content in the commercial
      concentrate. However, the experimental concentrate contained higher amounts of
      calcium. After 59 days of fattening, no significant difference was found among
      the two studied groups on the growth performance (p > 0.05), showing the same
      final body weight. In contrast, a significant difference was found (p </= 0.001) 
      in relation to the cost of the given diet. This could affect the price of the
      produced meat. At 37.85 +/- 0.78 kg live weight, 10 lambs fed with experimental
      concentrate were slaughtered. The dressing percentage was 46.65 %, with 2.49 % of
      carcass shrink. Furthermore, an interesting percentage of total muscle was
      obtained (63.73 %) with a good carcass conformation scoring 9.56. Compared to
      other breed sheep, Hamra carcass could be considered as the most valuable one
      economically.

TI  - Selection, characterisation and evaluation of potential probiotic Lactobacillus
      spp. isolated from poultry droppings.
PG  - 35-44
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0020 [doi]
AB  - Aim of the present study was to characterise and evaluate probiotic potential of 
      lactobacilli isolated from indigenous poultry. Lactobacilli were isolated from
      poultry droppings and identified by genus specific polymerase chain reaction and 
      16S rRNA gene sequencing. Isolates were characterised in vitro by their ability
      to tolerate low pH and bile salts, phytase activity, antimicrobial activity,
      antibiotic susceptibility profile, and autoaggregation and coaggregation with
      poultry gut pathogens. In vivo evaluation of selected isolates was done by their 
      effect on the body weight gain and immune response of broiler chicks. Total of
      90, one-day old chicks, were randomly divided in 9 groups and given selected
      lactobacilli alone and in combinations (10(8) cfu/bird, daily) from day 7 to day 
      35. Body weight gain and humoral immune response to New Castle Disease Virus
      (NDV) vaccine were determined weekly. Three lactobacilli isolates (SMP52, SMP64
      and SMP70) were selected as potentially probiotic bacteria on the basis of in
      vitro characterisation and identified as Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus
      casei and L. crispatus, respectively. Chicks supplemented with 'SMP52', 'SMP64', 
      'SMP70' and 'SMP64+SMP70' and a commercial probiotic product (Protexin) showed
      significantly higher mean weight gain per bird (1,584+/-35.2, 1,629+/-30.6,
      1,668+/-34.7, 1,619+/-29.5 and 1,576+/-31.7 g/bird, respectively) as compared to 
      negative control group (1,394+/-26.7 g/bird), on day 35. SMP 70 also showed
      significantly higher geometric mean titre against NDV vaccine at day 21 as
      compared to negative control. It is concluded that L. crispatus SMP52, L. casei
      SMP64 and L. crispatus SMP70 are potential probiotic candidates which alone or in
      different combinations may increase body weight of broilers.

TI  - Cattle handling technique can induce fatigued cattle syndrome in cattle not fed a
      beta adrenergic agonist.
PG  - 581-91
LID - 10.2527/jas.2015-9824 [doi]
AB  - Angus crossbred steers (n = 40; 563 +/- 44 kg) were used to examine the effects
      of handling method and fat thickness on the blood chemistry and physiology of
      market steers. Steers were blocked by backfat (BF) thickness and were randomly
      assigned to treatment groups: low-stress handling (LSH) and aggressive handling
      (AH). Cattle were then ran notdomly assigned to one of 5 blocks containing 4
      steers from the LSH and AH treatments. Steers in the LSH treatment were walked
      and AH cattle were run through a course of 1,540 m. Blood samples were obtained
      via jugular venipuncture before handling (BASE), at 770 m (LAP1), at 1,540 m
      (LAP2), and at1 h (1H) and 2 h (2H) after finishing the course. Blood samples
      were analyzed for plasma lactate (LAC), creatinine kinase (CK), base excess (BE),
      blood pH (pH), serum cortisol (CORT) concentrations, and venous carbon dioxide
      (PvCO2) and oxygen (PvO2) pressures. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and 
      rectal temperature (TEMP) were measured at the same intervals. Cattle in the AH
      treatment had greater ( < 0.05) LAC than those in LSH at BASE (4.1 vs. 3.0
      mmol/L), LAP1 (16.5 vs. 2.3 mmol/L), LAP2 (22.3 vs. 2.4 mmol/L), 1H (7.2 vs. 2.7 
      mmol/L), and 2H (4.0 vs. 2.5 mmol/L), respectively. Creatinine kinase and RR were
      not different (P > 0.14). Blood pH in AH cattle was decreased compared with that 
      in LSH cattle ( < 0.05) at LAP1 (7.25 vs. 7.45) and LAP2 (7.19 vs. 7.48) but was 
      not different ( > 0.13) at BASE, 1H, or 2H. Heart rate and TEMP were increased in
      AH cattle compared to LSH ( > 0.01). Serum cortisol was increased ( < 0.05) in AH
      compared to that in LSH cattle at LAP1 (87.5 vs. 58.9 nmol/L), LAP2 (144.4 vs.
      93.1 nmol/L), and 1H (113.5 vs. 53.1 nmol/L). Although RR was not differ notent
      between LSH and AH, PvCO2 was decreased in AH compared to that in LSH ( < 0.05)
      at LAP2 (30.6 vs. 39.3 mmHg) and PvO2 was increased at LAP1 (42.7 vs. 33.5 mmHg) 
      and at LAP2 (51.5 vs. 36.6 mmHg). Lactate was increased in AH cattle in the
      thicker BF group at 1H ( < 0.05), and blood pH was decreased at LAP1, LAP2, and
      1H ( < 0.05) compared to the thinner BF cohorts. Four AH steers became exhausted 
      (EXH) and did not complete the course. Increased CK, decreased PvCO2, and muscle 
      tremors occurred in EXH steers compared to non-exhausted AH cohorts. Results of
      this study show that AH causes physiologic and blood chemistry changes in steers,
      which can be potentially detrimental to cattle, emphasizing the need for
      low-stress handling practices.

TI  - Minor milk constituents are affected by protein concentration and forage
      digestibility in the feed ration.
PG  - 12-9
LID - 10.1017/S0022029915000692 [doi]
AB  - The present study was conducted in order to investigate if selected minor milk
      components would be indicative for the nutritional situation of the cow.
      Forty-eight dairy cows were offered a high digestible ration vs. a lower
      digestible ration combined with 2 protein levels in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. 
      Milk glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, cholesterol, triacylglycerides (TAG), uric
      acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) were measured and correlated mutually and
      towards other milking parameters (yield, h since last milking, days in milk
      (DIM), urea, etc). The variation range of the suggested variables were broad, a
      fact that may support their utilisation as predictive parameters. The content of 
      milk metabolites was significantly affected by the change in rations as milk
      glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, uric acid, and the ratio cholesterol:
      triacylglycerides increased with higher energy intake while BHBA and TAG
      decreased. The content of some of the milk metabolites changed during 24 h
      day/night periods: BHBA, cholesterol, uric acid and TAG increased whereas free
      glucose decreased in the night period. Certain associations between milk
      metabolites and calculated energy parameters like ECM, body condition score
      (BCS), and body weight gain were found, however, these associations were to some 
      extent explained by an interaction with DIM, just as changes in milk metabolites 
      during a 24 h period seems to interfere. It is concluded that the practical use
      of the suggested milk variables should be based on more than one metabolite and
      that stage of lactation and possibly time of the day where the milk is collected 
      should be incorporated in predictive models.

      in Pelibuey ewes during lactation.
PG  - 283-7
LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0947-8 [doi]
AB  - A study was conducted from December to April 2013, with the aim of evaluating a
      system of selective antiparasitic treatments using the FAMACHA(c) color chart
      compared with a conventional suppressive deworming system every 30 days in
      Pelibuey ewes during lactation. For the study, 54 ewes were used. They were
      randomly divided into two groups: FAMACHA and chemical treatments. The ewes in
      the first group received selective treatment depending on the ocular mucosa
      coloration (FAMACHA) and body condition score (BCS), while in the second group
      (chemical) all the animals remained under routine deworming every 30 days. Fecal 
      nematode egg counts, proportion of third-stage trichostrongylid larvae, body
      condition, coloration of the ocular mucosa, and packed cell volume in the ewes
      were determined, while in lambs only body weight (BW) was recorded. No
      significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in any of the studied variables 
      between groups; however, the use of antiparasitic drugs was reduced during the
      experimental period in the FAMACHA group and no deaths of lambs or ewes were
      recorded. The results indicate that during the lactation of ewes, a strategy of
      selective treatments can be implemented without showing deterioration in major
      health and productive parameters of these animals.

TI  - Evaluation of alternative school feeding models on nutrition, education,
      agriculture and other social outcomes in Ghana: rationale, randomised design and 
      baseline data.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s13063-015-1116-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 'Home-grown' school feeding programmes are complex interventions with
      the potential to link the increased demand for school feeding goods and services 
      to community-based stakeholders, including smallholder farmers and women's
      groups. There is limited rigorous evidence, however, that this is the case in
      practice. This evaluation will examine explicitly, and from a holistic
      perspective, the simultaneous impact of a national school meals programme on
      micronutrient status, alongside outcomes in nutrition, education and agriculture 
      domains. The 3-year study involves a cluster-randomised control trial designed
      around the scale-up of the national school feeding programme, including 116
      primary schools in 58 districts in Ghana. The randomly assigned interventions
      are: 1) a school feeding programme group, including schools and communities where
      the standard government programme is implemented; 2) 'home-grown' school feeding,
      including schools and communities where the standard programme is implemented
      alongside an innovative pilot project aimed at enhancing nutrition and
      agriculture; and 3) a control group, including schools and households from
      communities where the intervention will be delayed by at least 3 years,
      preferably without informing schools and households. Primary outcomes include
      child health and nutritional status, school participation and learning, and
      smallholder farmer income. Intermediate outcomes along the agriculture and
      nutrition pathways will also be measured. The evaluation will follow a
      mixed-method approach, including child-, household-, school- and community-level 
      surveys as well as focus group discussions with project stakeholders. The
      baseline survey was completed in August 2013 and the endline survey is planned
      for November 2015. RESULTS: The tests of balance show significant differences in 
      the means of a number of outcome and control variables across the intervention
      groups. Important differences across groups include marketed surplus, livestock
      income, per capita food consumption and intake, school attendance, and
      anthropometric status in the 2-5 and 5-15 years age groups. In addition,
      approximately 19 % of children in the target age group received some form of free
      school meals at baseline. CONCLUSION: Designing and implementing the evaluation
      of complex interventions is in itself a complex undertaking, involving a
      multi-disciplinary research team working in close collaboration with programme-
      and policy-level stakeholders. Managing the complexity from an analytical and
      operational perspective is an important challenge. The analysis of the baseline
      data indicates that the random allocation process did not achieve statistically
      comparable treatment groups. Differences in outcomes and control variables across
      groups will be controlled for when estimating treatment effects. TRIAL

TI  - Carcass and meat quality traits of chickens fed diets concurrently supplemented
      with vitamins C and E under constant heat stress.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if a diet supplemented
      simultaneously with vitamins C and E would alleviate the negative effects of heat
      stress, applied between 28 and 42 days of age, on performance, carcass and meat
      quality traits of broiler chickens. A total of 384 male broiler chickens were
      assigned to a completely randomized design, with a 2x3 factorial arrangement
      (diet with or without vitamin supplementation and two ambient temperatures plus a
      pair-feeding group) and 16 replicates. Chickens were kept in thermoneutral
      conditions up to 28 days of age. They were then housed in groups of four per
      cage, in three environmentally controlled chambers: two thermoneutral (22.5 and
      22.6 degrees C) and one for heat stress (32 degrees C). Half the chickens were
      fed a diet supplemented with vitamins C (257 to 288 mg/kg) and E (93 to 109
      mg/kg). In the thermoneutral chambers, half of the chickens were pair-fed to heat
      stressed chickens, receiving each day the average feed intake recorded in the
      heat stress chamber in the previous day. Meat physical quality analyses were
      performed on the pectoralis major muscle. No ambient temperaturexdiet
      supplementation interaction effects were detected on performance, carcass, or
      meat quality traits. The supplemented diet resulted in lower growth performance, 
      attributed either to a carry-over effect of the lower initial BW, or to a
      possible catabolic effect of vitamins C and E when supplemented simultaneously at
      high levels. Heat stress reduced slaughter and carcass weights, average daily
      gain and feed intake, and increased feed conversion. Growth performance of
      pair-fed chickens was similar to that of heat stressed chickens. Exposure to heat
      stress increased carcass and abdominal fat percentages, but reduced breast, liver
      and heart percentages. Pair-fed chickens showed the lowest fat percentage and
      their breast percentage was similar to controls. Heat stress increased meat pH
      and negatively affected meat color and cooking loss. In pair-fed chickens, meat
      color was similar to the heat stressed group. Shear force was not influenced by
      heat stress, but pair-fed chickens showed the tenderest meat. In conclusion,
      reduction in growth performance and negative changes in meat color in heat
      stressed chickens were attributed to depression in feed intake, whereas negative 
      changes in body composition, higher meat pH and cooking loss were credited to
      high ambient temperature per se. Diet supplementation with vitamins C and E as
      antioxidants did not mitigate any of these negative effects.

PG  - 155-72
LID - 10.1080/1745039X.2016.1141743 [doi]
AB  - The effect of partial or total dietary substitution of fishmeal (FM) by vegetal
      protein sources on growth and feed efficiency was carried out in on-growing
      gilthead sea bream (mean initial weight 131 g). The Control diet (FM 100)
      contained FM as the primary protein source, while in Diets FM 25 and FM 0 the FM 
      protein was replaced at 75% and 100%, respectively, by a vegetable protein
      mixture consisting of wheat gluten, soybean meal, rapeseed meal and crystalline
      amino acids. Diets FM 25 and FM 0 also contained krill meal at 47 g/kg in order
      to improve palatability. At the end of the trial (after 158 d), fish survival was
      above 90%. Final weight and the specific growth rate were statistically lower in 
      fish fed the Control diet (361 g and 0.64%/d), compared with 390-396 g and
      0.69-0.70%/d after feeding vegetal diets. No significant differences were found
      regarding feed intake and feed conversion ratio. The digestibility of protein and
      amino acids (determined with chromium oxide as indicator) was similar in all
      diets. The blood parameters were not significantly affected by treatments. The
      activity of trypsin and pepsin was significantly reduced after feeding Diet FM 0.
      In the distal intestine, the villi length in fish fed Diet FM 25 was
      significantly longer and the intestine of the fish fed the FM 100 diet showed a
      smaller number of goblet cells. In conclusion, a total FM substitution by a
      vegetal mix supplemented with synthetic amino acids in on-growing sea bream is
      feasible.

TI  - Carcass and meat quality of finished and non-finished Limousin heifers from
      alpine livestock systems differing in altitudinal origin of the forage.
PG  - 108-26
LID - 10.1080/1745039X.2015.1134398 [doi]
AB  - Effects of the alpine origin of the forage and of finishing on carcass and beef
      quality were quantified by modelling different alpine livestock system
      alternatives. Thirty-five Limousin heifers, initially weighing 383 +/- 45 kg,
      were fed fresh grass at 400 or 2000 m above sea level, or a 1:1 mixture of alpine
      grass and lowland grass hay at 2000 m. After 9 weeks, the six heaviest and oldest
      animals per group were slaughtered. The remaining animals were finished for 8
      weeks on a silage-concentrate diet in the lowlands to similar age and body weight
      as the first slaughtered group. Carcass and meat quality (M. longissimus
      thoracis) were assessed in various respects. The average daily gains achieved
      were of about 600 g/d and similar between forage-type groups. Dressing percentage
      was 53.5% in the alpine and 57.2% in the lowland group. Carcass conformation and 
      fat cover scores did not differ between forage-type groups. The meat from the
      alpine groups had greater ultimate pH and smaller redness, yellowness and protein
      contents. Still, these differences were of minor practical relevance. There was
      no forage-type effect on water-holding capacity and shear force of the meat. The 
      alpine systems enhanced the proportion of alpha-linolenic acid in intramuscular
      fat and decreased the levels of some volatile compounds in perirenal fat.
      Finishing resulted in compensatory growth, especially in the animals previously
      fed lowland grass. There was a trend for the finished compared with the
      non-finished groups towards greater carcass fat cover and intramuscular fat
      content. Additionally, ultimate pH was smaller and cooking loss was greater with 
      than without finishing. Meat colour differences were also observed. Shear force
      was not affected by finishing. The finished animals had a smaller alpha-linolenic
      acid proportion in the intramuscular fat. In conclusion, the forage type had
      small effects on carcass and meat quality. Finishing did not substantially
      improve carcass and meat quality. The (alpine) grass-specific differences in
      fatty acid profile found in the unfinished cattle were not present in the
      finished animals.

PG  - S3-12
LID - 10.3109/14992027.2015.1122239 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three
      interventions designed to promote hearing protector device (HPD) use. DESIGN:
      Randomized controlled trial. STUDY SAMPLE: Farm operators (n = 491) were randomly
      assigned to one of five intervention groups: (1) interactive web-based
      information with mailed assortment of HPDs; (2) Interactive web-based information
      only; (3) static web-based information with mailed assortment of HPDs; (4) Static
      web-based information only; or (5) mailed assortment of HPDs only. Data were
      analysed using a mixed model approach. RESULTS: HPD use increased among all
      participants, and increased more among participants receiving the mailed HPDs
      (with or without information) compared to participants receiving other
      interventions. Participants receiving the interactive web-based information had
      comparable increased use of HPDs to those receiving the static web-based
      information. Participants receiving the mailed HPDs had more positive situational
      influences scale scores than other participants. Program satisfaction was highest
      among mailed and web-based information groups. CONCLUSIONS: A mailed assortment
      of hearing protectors was more effective than information. Interactive and static
      information delivered via web were similarly effective. Programs interested in
      increasing HPD use among farmers should consider making hearing protectors more
      available to farmers.

TI  - Influence of Permissive Parenting on Youth Farm Risk Behaviors.
PG  - 244-52
LID - 10.1080/1059924X.2016.1179610 [doi]
AB  - Farm youth continue to experience high rates of injuries and premature deaths as 
      a result of agricultural activities. Increased parental permissiveness is
      positively associated with many different types of high-risk behaviors in youth. 
      This study explored whether permissive parenting (fathering and mothering)
      predicts youth unsafe behaviors on the farm. Data were analyzed for 67 youth and 
      their parents. Families were recruited from a statewide farm publication, through
      youth organizations (i.e., FFA [Future Farmers of America]), local newspapers,
      farmer referrals, and through the Cooperative Extension Network. Hierarchical
      multiple regression was completed. Results revealed that fathers and mothers who 
      practiced lax-inconsistent disciplining were more likely to have youth who
      indulged in unsafe farm behaviors. Key hypotheses confirmed that permissive
      parenting (lax-inconsistent disciplining) by parents continued to predict youth
      unsafe farm behaviors, even after youth age, youth gender, youth personality
      factor of risk-taking, and father's unsafe behaviors (a measure associated with
      modeling) were all taken into account. A key implication is that parents may play
      an important role in influencing youth farm safety behaviors. Parents (especially
      fathers) need to devote time to discuss farm safety with their youth. Farm safety
      interventions need to involve parents as well as address and respect the culture 
      and values of families. Interventions need to focus not only on safe farm
      practices, but also promote positive parenting practices, including increased
      parent-youth communication about safety, consistent disciplining strategies, and 
      increased monitoring and modeling of safe farm behaviors by parents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an exploratory 12-week nutrition, cooking,
      and gardening trial (LA Sprouts) on preference for fruit and vegetables (FV);
      willingness to try FV; identification of FV; self-efficacy to garden, eat, and
      cook FV; motivation to garden, eat, and cook FV; attitudes toward FV; nutrition
      and gardening knowledge; and home gardening habits. DESIGN: Randomized controlled
      trial. SETTING: Four elementary schools. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred four
      predominately Hispanic/Latino third- through fifth-grade students were randomized
      to either the LA Sprouts group (n = 167 students) or control group (n = 137
      students). INTERVENTION: Twelve-week after-school nutrition, cooking, and
      gardening intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Determinants of dietary behavior
      as measured by questionnaire at baseline and postintervention. ANALYSIS: Analyses
      of covariance. RESULTS: After the 12-week program, compared with controls, LA
      Sprouts participants improved scores for identification of vegetables (+11% vs
      +5%; P = .001) and nutrition and gardening knowledge (+14.5% vs -5.0%; P = .003),
      and were more likely to garden at home (+7.5% vs -4.4%; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS:
      The LA Sprouts program positively affected a number of determinants of dietary
      behaviors that suggest possible mechanisms by which gardening and nutrition
      education act to improve dietary intake and health outcomes.

AB  - One hundred two samples of feeds made in Lithuania, which included maize silage, 
      grass-legume silage, hay and ensiled crimped maize were investigated during
      2008-2012 for contamination with some mycotoxins. The highest concentrations of
      mycotoxins determined were those of deoxynivalenol (DON)--471.0 mug/kg and
      aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)--21.2 mug/kg in ryegrass silage from bales, and zearalenone
      (ZEA)--625.0 mug/kg in maize silage from trenches. The present study has been
      carried out based on these data because animal feeds contaminated with mycotoxins
      can cause reduced productivity of dairy cows and health disorders in the long
      term. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term exposure of toxic
      effects of a diet naturally contaminated with low concentrations of mycotoxins on
      milk composition and biochemical, hematological, immunological parameters of
      dairy cows and to determine the anti-mycotoxin effect of Mycofix Plus 3.E. Twenty
      eight clinically healthy, medium productive Lithuanian Red cows were selected.
      ZEA was a major contaminant found in the corn silage at concentration levels of
      up to 1000.0 mug/kg of dry matter. DON was the second major found in the hay at
      concentration levels of up to 600.0 mug/kg of dry matter. The highest
      concentration AFB1- 10.0 mug/kg was determined in ground barley. The
      Anti-Mycotoxin Additive (AMA) Mycofix Plus 3.E was given individually to 14 cows 
      at a concentration of 40.0 g daily for 9 weeks. The present results indicate that
      feeds naturally contaminated with low concentration of mycotoxins produced by
      Fusarium spp. and Aspergillus spp. in a diet of dairy cows can have a negative
      influence on somatic cell count, blood parameters and immunity. The addition of
      an Anti-Mycotoxin Additive (Mycofix Plus 3.E) to diet of dairy cows can prevent
      many of these effects.

AB  - The study was conducted in Manyara Region, to determine the effect of concentrate
      supplementation on growth performance and foraging behavior of zebu steers.
      Twenty zebu steers were distributed equally into two dietary groups: pasture +
      concentrate (PS) and natural pasture alone (NP). The animals' body weight and
      body condition scores were estimated every 2 weeks. The focal observation
      technique was used to determine grazing behavior. The average daily gain (ADG)
      was significantly higher (P </= 0.05) in the PS than in the NP. Significant less 
      time (P </= 0.05) was spent in feeding by animals in the PS than those in the NP.
      Significant less bite rates (P </= 0.05) were also observed in the PS than in the
      NP. The most highly abundant forage species exhibited low CP contents but were
      most frequently eaten by the focal animals. Strategic supplementation with
      locally available concentrates is recommended for profitable ruminant
      productivity and environmentally friendly grazing strategy.

LID - 10.1017/S0007114515003529 [doi]
AB  - Barramundi (Lates calcarifer), a catadromous teleost of significant and growing
      commercial importance, are reported to have limited fatty acid bioconversion
      capability and therefore require preformed long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) as dietary
      essential fatty acid (EFA). In this study, the response of juvenile barramundi
      (47.0 g/fish initial weight) fed isolipidic and isoenergetic diets with 8.2%
      added oil was tested. The experimental test diets were either devoid of fish oil 
      (FO), and thus with no n-3 LC-PUFA (FO FREE diet), or with a low inclusion of FO 
      (FO LOW diet). These were compared against a control diet containing only FO (FO 
      CTRL diet) as the added lipid source, over an 8-week period. Interim samples and 
      measurements were taken fortnightly during the trial in order to define the
      aetiology of the onset and progression of EFA deficiency. After 2 weeks, the fish
      fed the FO FREE and FO LOW diets had significantly lower live-weights, and after 
      8 weeks significant differences were detected for all performance parameters. The
      fish fed the FO FREE diet also had a significantly higher incidence of external
      abnormalities. The transcription of several genes involved in fatty acid
      metabolism was affected after 2 weeks of feeding, showing a rapid nutritional
      regulation. This experiment documents the aetiology of the onset and the
      progression of EFA deficiency in juvenile barramundi and demonstrates that such
      deficiencies can be detected within 2 weeks in juvenile fish.

TI  - Using Family-Focused Garden, Nutrition, and Physical Activity Programs To Reduce 
      Childhood Obesity: The Texas! Go! Eat! Grow! Pilot Study.
PG  - 707-14
LID - 10.1089/chi.2015.0032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The TEXAS! GROW! EAT! GO! (TGEG) randomized, control trial is a
      5-year study to measure the impact of a nutrition and gardening intervention
      and/or physical activity (PA) intervention on the weight status of third-grade
      students. This article describes the results of the pilot study to test the
      feasibility of two interventions and test the measures to be used in the main
      trial. METHODS: The pilot study was conducted in one school with third-grade
      students and their parents or guardians. The Junior Master Gardner (JMG) and Walk
      Across Texas (WAT) interventions were implemented over a 5-month period in three 
      third-grade classrooms during spring 2012. The respective interventions focused
      on improving healthy eating and PA behaviors of children and their families.
      Baseline and immediate post-test data were collected from students and
      parents/guardians to measure four child, four parent, and four parent-child
      interaction behaviors. Process data regarding implementation were also collected 
      from teachers and school administration. RESULTS: Forty-four students and 34
      parents or guardians provided both pre- and post-test data. Paired-sample t-tests
      showed statistically significant changes in student knowledge, vegetable
      preferences, vegetable consumption, and home food availability (all p < 0.05). At
      baseline, participants' weight status categories included 57% obese, 10%
      overweight, and 31% normal weight. Postintervention, weight status categories
      included 39% obese, 16% overweight, and normal 45%. Data collected from teachers 
      indicated high levels of implementation fidelity. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of 
      both interventions occurred at a very high fidelity level, which led to positive 
      changes in BMI status, and several dietary and PA behaviors. Although the pilot
      study indicated feasibility of the two interventions for school implementation,
      results guided revisions to the TGEG program and its survey instruments.

AB  - Twenty-eight newborn Holstein heifer calves from the university herd and 8
      newborn Holstein heifer calves from a commercial herd were blocked by birth and
      herd into 1 of 4 treatments: conventional [20% crude protein (CP), 20% fat] milk 
      replacer (MR; treatment C) with (1) or without (0) human visitation, or a higher 
      plane of MR nutrition (28% CP, 20% fat) regimen (treatment A) with (1) or (0)
      without human visitation. Calves on C MR treatments received 454g of MR from d 2 
      to 41. Calves on A MR received 916g of MR from d 2 to 8 and 1134g of MR from d 9 
      to 41. Visitation with calves occurred at 1030 and 1430h daily from d 1 to 56 and
      comprised verbal stimulation and stirring of starter grain. An opaque curtain
      divided the calf nursery, with calves in the front half assigned to visitation
      treatments and those in the rear half not assigned to visitation treatments.
      Calves were fed their MR treatment until d 43 (preweaning), after which all
      calves received half of their allotment of MR until d 49 (weaning). Calves were
      tracked for the next week until d 56 (postweaning). Starter grain and MR intakes 
      were measured daily along with weekly body weight and skeletal measurements. One 
      half of the calves on each treatment had blood samples taken via jugular
      venipuncture on d 41 (preweaning), 43, 45, 47, 49, and 51 (postweaning) to
      evaluate blood glucose, urea, nonesterified fatty acids, and cortisol
      concentrations. During the preweaning and weaning phases, calves on A0 and A1
      treatments consumed more MR, less starter, and weighed more than the C0 and C1
      calves. Calves on A0 and A1 had greater average daily gain (ADG), hip and withers
      gain, were taller at the hip, and had larger girths during the preweaning phase. 
      Overall, body weight, withers and hip heights, and heart girths were greater in
      A0 andA1 calves during the weaning week. Efficiency of utilization of estimated
      metabolizable energy (ME) intake (ADG/ME) were similar. Glucose and nonesterified
      fatty acids concentrations were greater in visited calves preweaning. An
      interaction for glucose was observed during weaning, with A1 calves having the
      highest concentration and A0 calves having the lowest concentrations during
      weaning. Cortisol tended to be higher in visited calves during weaning.
      Postweaning, calves formerly fed A0 and A1 treatments had lower blood glucose and
      tended to have higher urea and cortisol concentrations than C0 and C1 treatments.
      The higher plane of nutrition fed calves tended to have higher cortisol
      concentrations indicating that they experienced more stress due to the removal of
      MR more than calves fed conventionally. Calves fed the higher plane of MR
      nutrition consumed more dry matter, ME, and water weighed more, had a greater
      ADG, and were taller than calves fed the conventional MR. These calves were more 
      efficient (ADG/dry matter intake) when expressed on a dry matter basis, but had
      similar efficiency when expressed on an ME basis (ADG/ME). Visiting calves did
      little to reduce the stress of weaning when calves are fed the higher plane of
      nutrition MR feeding regimen.

AB  - Our objective was to investigate the quantitative and qualitative effects of
      propylene glycol (PG) allocation on postpartum adipose tissue mobilization in
      over-conditioned Holstein cows. Nine ruminally cannulated and arterially
      catheterized cows were, at parturition, randomly assigned to a ruminal pulse dose
      of either 500g of tap water (n=4) or 500g of PG (n=5) once a day. The PG was
      given with the morning feeding for 4 wk postpartum (treatment period), followed
      by a 4-wk follow-up period. All cows were fed the same prepartum and postpartum
      diets. At -16 (+/-3), 4 (+/-0), 15 (+/-1) and 29 (+/-2) days in milk (DIM), body 
      composition was determined using the deuterium oxide dilution technique, liver
      and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were collected, and mammary gland
      nutrient uptake was measured. Weekly blood samples were obtained during the
      experiment and daily blood samples were taken from -7 to 7 DIM. Postpartum feed
      intake and milk yield was not affected by PG allocation. The body content of
      lipid was not affected by treatment, but tended to decrease from 4 to 29 DIM with
      both treatments. Except for the first week postpartum, no difference in plasma
      nonesterified fatty acids concentration was noted between treatments in the
      treatment period. Yet, PG allocation resulted in decreased plasma concentrations 
      of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and increased plasma concentrations of glucose. In 
      the follow-up period, plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids,
      glucose, and BHB did not differ between treatments. Additionally, the change in
      abundance of proteins in adipose tissue biopsies from prepartum to 4 DIM was not 
      affected by treatment. In conclusion, the different variables to assess body fat 
      mobilization were concurrent and showed that a 4-wk postpartum PG allocation had 
      limited effect on adipose tissue mobilization. The main effect was an enhanced
      glucogenic status with PG. No carry-over effect of PG allocation was recorded for
      production or plasma metabolites, and, hence, a new period of metabolic adaption 
      to lactation seemed to occur with PG treatment after ceasing PG allocation. Thus,
      PG seemed to induce a 2-step adaption to lactation, reducing the immediate
      postpartum nadir and peak of plasma concentration of glucose and BHB,
      respectively; which is beneficial for postpartum cows at high risk of
      lipid-related metabolic diseases.

TI  - Dietary Linseed Oil Reduces Growth While Differentially Impacting LC-PUFA
      Synthesis and Accretion into Tissues in Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis).
PG  - 1219-32
LID - 10.1007/s11745-015-4079-8 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of replacing dietary fish oil
      (FO) with linseed oil (LO) on growth, fatty acid composition and regulation of
      lipid metabolism in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) juveniles. Fish (17.5 g
      initial body weight) were fed isoproteic and isoenergetic diets containing 116
      g/kg of lipid for 10 weeks. Fish fed the LO diet displayed lower growth rates and
      lower levels of DHA in the liver and muscle than fish fed the FO diet, while
      mortality was not affected by dietary treatment. However, DHA content recorded in
      the liver and muscle of fish fed the LO diet remained relatively high, despite a 
      weight gain of 134 % and a reduced dietary level of long-chain polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (LC-PUFA), suggesting endogenous LC-PUFA biosynthesis. This was
      supported by the higher amounts of pathway intermediates, including 18:4n-3,
      20:3n-3, 20:4n-3, 18:3n-6 and 20:3n-6, recorded in the liver of fish fed the LO
      diet in comparison with those fed the FO diet. However, fads2 and elovl5 gene
      expression and FADS2 enzyme activity were comparable between the two groups.
      Similarly, the expression of genes involved in eicosanoid synthesis was not
      modulated by dietary LO. Thus, the present study demonstrated that in fish fed LO
      for 10 weeks, growth was reduced but DHA levels in tissues were largely
      maintained compared to fish fed FO, suggesting a physiologically relevant rate of
      endogenous LC-PUFA biosynthesis capacity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the parent- and early care education 
      (ECE) center-based Lunch is in the Bag program on communication between parent,
      child, and their ECE center providers around fruits, vegetables and whole grain
      foods (FVWG). METHOD: A total of n=30 ECE center; 577 parent-child dyads
      participated in this group-randomized controlled trial conducted from 2011 to
      2013 in Texas (n=15 ECE center, 327 dyads intervention group; n=15 ECE center,
      250 dyads comparison group). Parent-child and parent-ECE center provider
      communication was measured using a parent-reported survey administered at
      baseline and end of the five-week intervention period. Multilevel linear
      regression analysis was used to compare the pre-to-post intervention changes in
      the parent-child and parent-ECE center provider communication scales.
      Significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: At baseline, parent-child and parent-ECE
      center provider communication scores were low. There was a significant increase
      post-intervention in the parent-ECE center provider communication around
      vegetables (Adjusted beta=0.78, 95%CI: 0.13, 1.43, p=0.002), and around fruit
      (Adjusted beta=0.62, 95%CI: 0.04, 0.20, p=0.04) among the parents in the
      intervention group as compared to those in the comparison group. There were no
      significant intervention effects on parent-child communication. CONCLUSION: Lunch

AB  - This clinical trial investigated the impact of a six-week supplementation with
      fish oil and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLA2G4A and PLA2G6 genes
      on total omega-6 fatty acid (n-6 FA) levels in plasma phospholipids (PL) and
      plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in 191 subjects. Interaction effects
      between SNPs and supplementation modulated total n-6 FAs and CRP levels in both
      men and women. Associations between SNPs and total n-6 FA levels and between SNPs
      and CRP levels were identified in men, independently of supplementation.
      Supplementation decreased total n-6 FAs without affecting plasma CRP levels.
      Changes in CRP levels correlated positively with changes in total n-6 FAs in men 
      (r=0.25 p=0.01), but not in women. In conclusion, total n-6 FA levels in plasma
      PL and plasma CRP levels are modulated by SNPs within PLA2G4A and PLA2G6 genes
      alone or in combination with fish oil supplementation.

TI  - Community-based educational intervention improved the diversity of complementary 
      diets in western Kenya: results from a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 3406-19
LID - 10.1017/S1368980015000920 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lack of diversity is a major factor contributing to inadequate
      nutrient intakes among children during the complementary feeding period in many
      rural areas in developing countries. This has been attributed to inadequate
      feeding practices and nutrition knowledge among their caregivers. The aim of the 
      present study was to assess the effect of an educational intervention on
      children's dietary diversity and nutrition knowledge of caregivers. DESIGN:
      Cluster randomization was applied and twenty matched village pairs were randomly 
      assigned to the intervention or control group. The nutrition education
      intervention consisted of four sessions comprising of group trainings and cooking
      demonstrations that were conducted over a period of 5 months. SETTING: Households
      in rural communities in Bondo and Teso South sub-counties, western Kenya.
      SUBJECTS: Caregivers with children aged 6-17 months receiving nutrition
      education. RESULTS: The children's dietary diversity scores (CDDS) and nutrition 
      knowledge scores of the caregivers improved significantly in the intervention
      group at endline. The treatment effect on CDDS was positive and significant
      (P=0.001). The CDDS rate of the children in the intervention group was 27% larger
      than it would have been without the treatment effect. The intervention also had a
      significant effect on the caregivers' nutrition knowledge scores (incidence rate 
      ratio=2.05; P<0.001). However, the nutrition knowledge of the caregivers did not 
      have a significant effect on CDDS (P=0.731). CONCLUSIONS: The nutrition education
      intervention led to improvements in children's dietary diversity and nutrition
      knowledge of the caregivers.

TI  - Nonhatching Decapsulated Artemia Cysts As a Replacement to Artemia Nauplii in
      Juvenile and Adult Zebrafish Culture.
PG  - 457-61
LID - 10.1089/zeb.2014.1031 [doi]
AB  - Feeding Artemia nauplii as the main nutrition source for zebrafish is a common
      practice for many research facilities. Culturing live feed can be time-consuming 
      and requires additional equipment to be purchased, maintained, and cleaned.
      Nonhatching decapsulated Artemia cysts (decaps) are a commercially available
      product that can be fed directly to fish. Several other ornamental fish species
      have been successfully cultured using decaps. Replacing Artemia nauplii with
      decaps could reduce the overall time and costs associated with the operation of a
      zebrafish facility. The objective of this study was to determine if decaps could 
      be a suitable replacement to Artemia nauplii in juvenile and adult zebrafish
      culture. Wild-type zebrafish were fed one of three dietary treatments: decaps
      only, nauplii only, or a standard consisting of nauplii plus a commercially
      prepared pellet food. Survival, growth (length and weight), and embryo production
      were analyzed between the treatments. Fish receiving the decap diet demonstrated 
      a significantly higher growth and embryo production when compared to the fish
      receiving the nauplii-only diet. When comparing the decap fish to the standard
      fish, no significant difference was found in mean survival, mean weight at 90
      days postfertilization, or mean embryo production. It was determined that
      nonhatching decapsulated Artemia cysts can be used as a suitable replacement to
      Artemia nauplii in juvenile and adult zebrafish culture.

TI  - Vaccination against Staphylococcus aureus mastitis in two Swedish dairy herds.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1186/s13028-015-0171-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a common udder pathogen in dairy cows, and
      may cause severe mastitis problems in some herds. In herds where normal control
      measures are not successful, vaccination might be an additional tool to use if
      sufficiently efficient. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy
      of a commercially available vaccine (Startvac((R)), Hipra, Spain) in two
      commercial Swedish dairy herds where the control programs for S. aureus mastitis 
      had been unsuccessful. Within each herd cows were randomly assigned to vaccine or
      control groups, and effects on udder health and milk production during 120 days
      after calving, and survival during the following lactation were evaluated.
      RESULTS: A field study was performed in two high producing Swedish herds having
      approximately 600 (herd A) and 200 (herd B) cows. During 12 months, cows with odd
      numbers were vaccinated three times around calving according to label protocol,
      while cows with even numbers constituted the not vaccinated control group.
      Quarter milk samples for bacteriological culturing were collected from all cases 
      of clinical and subclinical mastitis. The outcome was evaluated during 120 days
      after calving using data on SCC and daily milk yield at monthly milk recordings, 
      and incidence of mastitis due to S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci,
      streptococci and coliforms. Cow survival throughout lactation was also studied.
      In herd A, 239 and 240 cows were included in the vaccinated and control groups,
      respectively. Corresponding numbers for herd B was 126 and 151 cows. Significant 
      differences between vaccinated and control groups were not found in any of the
      parameters investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with a commercial polyvalent
      vaccine did not have any beneficial effects on udder health, milk production or
      survival in two commercial dairy herds with mastitis problems due to S. aureus.

TI  - Vitamin D receptor Cdx-2-dependent response of central obesity to vitamin D
      intake in the subjects with type 2 diabetes: a randomised clinical trial.
PG  - 1375-84
LID - 10.1017/S0007114515003049 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of daily intake of vitamin
      D-fortified yogurt drink (doogh) on central obesity indicators in subjects with
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the possible modulation of this effect by vitamin D
      receptor (VDR) Cdx-2 genotypes. A total of sixty T2D subjects were randomly
      allocated to two groups to receive either plain doogh (PD; n 29, containing 170
      mg Ca and no vitamin D/250 ml) or vitamin D3-fortified doogh (FD; n 31,
      containing 170 mg Ca and 12.5 mug/250 ml) twice a day for 12 weeks.
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), glycaemic as well as adiposity indicators were
      evaluated before and after the intervention. VDR-Cdx-2 genotypes in extended
      number of T2D subjects in the FD group (n 60) were determined as AA, GA and GG.
      After 12 weeks, in FD compared with PD, serum 25(OH)D increased (+35.4 v. -4.8
      nmol/l; P<0.001) and mean changes of waist circumference (WC; -1.3 v. +1.6 cm;
      P=0.02), body fat mass (FM; -1.9 v. +0.60 %; P=0.008), truncal fat (TF; -1.1 v.
      0.13 %; P=0.003) and visceral adipose tissue (-0.80 v. +0.37 AU; P<0.001)
      decreased significantly. Circulating 25(OH)D was raised only in the AA group
      (34.8 nmo/l in AA group v. -6.4 nmol/l in AG and -1.6 nmol/l in GG groups;
      P<0.001), which was accompanied by a significant decrease in changes of WC
      (P=0.004), FM% (P=0.01) and TF% (P<0.001) in the AA genotype. Daily intake of
      vitamin D-FD for 12 weeks improved the central obesity indices in T2D subjects,
      and the improvement was more pronounced in the carriers of the AA genotype of
      VDR-Cdx-2.

TI  - Dietetic and Psychological Mindfulness Workshops for the Management of Cachectic 
      Cancer Patients. A Randomized Study.
PG  - 6311-5
AB  - AIM: To determine if actively-treated cancer patients developing cachexia could
      benefit from participation to mindfulness workshops. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Subjects developing cachexia signs while treated for cancer were randomized in a 
      trial aiming to compare an experimental group that would participate to specific 
      workshops based on mindfulness alternating dietetic and psychological approaches,
      and a control group managed in accordance to usual practice. RESULTS: The
      recruitment was difficult (12% of the approached population). Finally 53 patients
      accepted to participate. Despite an unpredictable compliance of workshop
      participants, the final satisfaction score attained 75%. In comparison with the
      control group, patients randomized to the experimental group showed a significant
      benefit with an increase of their body weight and an improvement of their WHO
      status score. They also experienced an improvement of emotional function and
      observation faculty as well as a relief of fatigue and some digestive disorders. 
      CONCLUSION: Selected cachectic cancer patients may benefit from this experimental
      approach. This approach may, however, be difficult to implement on a large scale.

TI  - Shade use by small groups of domestic horses in a hot, sunny environment.
PG  - 5455-64
LID - 10.2527/jas.2015-9520 [doi]
AB  - Horses in the United States are commonly managed in outside pens or pastures in
      small groups. Limited research on shade use by domestic horses housed singly in
      individual pens has shown benefits and a preference for using available shade.
      The objective of this study was to examine the amount of shade use and the
      behavioral and physiological responses of small groups of horses when housed with
      access to shade (SH) and without access to shade (SUN). Thirty-six horses were
      randomized into 3 consecutive trials using 3 horses per group and 4 groups per
      trial. Groups experienced 5 d in each treatment in a crossover design. Weather
      factors were measured with automated sensors 24 h/d throughout the study. The
      mean afternoon ambient temperature was 31.0 degrees C with relative humidity of
      32%. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, and skin temperature were recorded at 
      1000, 1330, and 1900 h daily. Venous blood samples were obtained on Days 0 and 5 
      to measure serum cortisol, the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, and hematocrit.
      Behavioral observations for presence in shade, standing near or away from water, 
      locomotion, and foraging were recorded at 5-min intervals from 1400 to 1900 h
      daily. Insect avoidance behaviors were recorded hourly during that same time
      period for 1 min/horse. Horses in the SH treatment were observed using shade in
      7.1% of observations between 1400 and 1900 h, and behavioral differences were
      observed between the SH and SUN treatments. When in the SUN treatment, horses
      stood near the water troughs more (18.5 vs. 14.2% of observations; = 0.029) and
      foraged less (29.3 vs. 33.8% of observations; < 0.001) than when in the SH
      treatment. There were no treatment differences for other behaviors or for
      physiological measures ( > 0.05). Provision of shade structures accessible to
      groups of mature, healthy horses in hot, sunny environments should be considered 
      in developing future guidelines for best management practices for horses.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to determine effects of feeding birdsfoot trefoil
      hay-based diets in comparison with an alfalfa hay-based diet on N utilization
      efficiency, ruminal fermentation, and lactational performance by mid-lactation
      dairy cows. Nine multiparous lactating Holstein cows (131 +/- 22.6 d in milk), 3 
      of which were rumen fistulated, were fed 3 experimental diets in a replicated 3 x
      3 Latin square design with 3 periods of 14 d of adaptation and 7 d of data and
      sample collection. Within squares, cows were randomly assigned to diets as
      follows: alfalfa hay-based diet (AHT), alfalfa and birdsfoot trefoil hay-based
      diet (ABT), and birdsfoot trefoil hay-based diet (BT). Intakes of dry matter and 
      crude protein were similar across treatments, whereas ABT and BT diets resulted
      in decreased fiber intake compared with AHT. Feeding BT tended to increase
      neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with AHT and ABT. Milk yield
      tended to increase for cows consuming ABT or BT diets. Milk true protein
      concentration and yield were greater for cows consuming ABT relative to those fed
      AHT. Concentration of total volatile fatty acids tended to increase by cows fed
      BT compared with those fed AHT and ABT. Feeding birdsfoot trefoil hay in a total 
      mixed ration resulted in a tendency to decrease acetate proportion, but it tended
      to increase propionate proportion, leading to a tendency to decrease
      acetate-to-propionate ratio. Whereas concentration of ammonia-N was similar
      across treatments, cows offered BT exhibited greater microbial protein yield
      relative to those fed AHT and ABT. Cows offered birdsfoot trefoil hay diets
      secreted more milk N than AHT, resulting in improved N utilization efficiency for
      milk N. The positive effects due to feeding birdsfoot trefoil hay were attributed
      to enhanced neutral detergent fiber digestion, and thus it could replace alfalfa 
      hay in high-forage dairy diets while improving N utilization efficiencies and
      maintaining lactational performance compared with alfalfa hay.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a standardized
      botanical extract of Croton lechleri, named crofelemer extract, on fecal dry
      matter and fecal scores on diarrheic newborn Holstein bull calves induced by
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A double-blinded randomized clinical trial was 
      performed in which 60 newborn Holstein bull calves were clean caught and
      transported to an isolation facility where calves were individually housed and
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo (control), enteric-coated
      formulation of crofelemer extract (ECROF), and nonenteric-coated formulation of
      crofelemer extract (CROF). Diarrhea was induced at first feeding with an inoculum
      of the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ATCC 31616) administered with a third of
      the recommended dose of a colostrum replacer. All calves enrolled in this study
      received treatments starting on the second feeding (diarrhea onset) and
      treatments were administered before feeding time (0600 and 1600h) for 6 feedings 
      consecutively. All calves in this study had failure of passive transfer. The only
      cause of death in this study was due to septicemia, accounting for 1 death out of
      each treatment group. All the calves were examined twice daily, within 2h after
      feeding, from d 1 (prechallenge) until 10, on d 15, and a last examination on d
      25 of life. Five parameters were evaluated during each examination; rectal
      temperature, clinical assessment of dehydration status, fecal scores, attitude,
      and appetite. No differences were observed between treatment groups for rectal
      temperature, attitude, and appetite. Fecal dry matter was analyzed as
      prechallenge fecal dry matter, dry matter during treatment, and fecal dry matter 
      after treatment cessation. No difference in prechallenge fecal dry matter was
      observed and prechallenge fecal dry matter was used as a covariate in the models.
      Fecal dry matter during treatment was significantly higher for ECROF calves when 
      compared with control calves and CROF calves. Additionally, ECROF fecal dry
      matter after treatment cessation had a statistical tendency to be higher when
      compared with control calves. Together, these results suggest that enteric-coated
      formulation of the standardized crofelemer extract, a natural-product with
      antisecretory properties, can significantly increase fecal dry matter of neonatal
      calves with experimentally induced enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhea.
      More research is needed to test the efficacy of enteric-coated crofelemer on
      incidence and severity of secretory diarrhea on calves under natural challenge
      conditions.

TI  - Home-based community health worker intervention to reduce pesticide exposures to 
      farmworkers' children: A randomized-controlled trial.
PG  - 608-15
LID - 10.1038/jes.2015.39 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a randomized-controlled trial of a home-based intervention to reduce
      pesticide exposures to farmworkers' children in Monterey County, California
      (n=116 families). The intervention consisted of three home-based educational
      sessions delivered by community health workers in Spanish. Measurements of
      organophosphate (OP) insecticide metabolites in child urine (n=106) and
      pesticides in home floor wipes (n=103) were collected before and after the
      intervention. Median child urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolite levels were
      slightly lower among the intervention group children at follow-up compared with
      baseline, albeit nonsignificantly. DAP metabolite levels in the control group
      children were markedly higher at follow-up compared with baseline. In adjusted
      models, intervention participation was associated with a 51% decrease in total
      DAP metabolite levels. Carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, dacthal, diazinon,
      malathion, and trans-permethrin were commonly detected in the floor wipes. In
      adjusted models, intervention participation was significantly associated with a
      37% decrease in trans-permethrin floor wipe levels in homes, but not OP or other 
      agricultural pesticides. In summary, intervention group children had slightly
      reduced pesticide exposures, whereas child exposures were higher among the
      control group. Additional intervention studies evaluating methods to reduce
      pesticide exposures to farmworker families and children are needed.

TI  - Protocol of a test of hearing health education programs for farm and rural youth.
PG  - 1061
LID - 10.1186/s12889-015-2393-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Farm and rural youth have frequent exposure to hazardous noise on the
      farm and recreationally, and have an increased prevalence of noise-induced
      hearing loss. There is a lack of programs to prepare this high-risk population to
      use hearing conservation strategies. METHODS: The purpose of this project is to
      test innovative hearing health education programs delivered to a large target
      group and to determine the effectiveness and sustainability of these programs in 
      promoting hearing health among farm and rural youth. Specifically, this project
      includes: a) an interactive face-to-face informational program alone, b) an
      interactive face-to-face informational program followed by an Internet-based
      booster, and c) a no-intervention control. Sites will include selected affiliates
      of a major farm youth safety education organization. Data will be collected at
      baseline, 3, and 12 months. A linear mixed model will be used to compare the
      effectiveness of the three interventions over time. Descriptive statistics will
      be used to compare program costs and sustainability ratings. DISCUSSION: Outcomes
      of this project will provide knowledge necessary to implement quality and
      cost-effective services to farm and rural youth, a high-risk and underserved
      population, that can be implemented and sustained after the study is completed.

      in pregnant Holstein dairy cattle following administration of a multivalent
      killed virus vaccine.
PG  - 913-20
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.76.10.913 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a commercially available multivalent killed
      virus vaccine on serum neutralizing (SN) and colostrum neutralizing (CN)
      antibodies against bovine herpesvirus (BHV) type 1 and bovine viral diarrhea
      virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2 in pregnant dairy cattle. ANIMALS: 49 Holstein dairy
      cattle. PROCEDURES :25 cattle were vaccinated (IM injection) at least 60 days
      prior to calving (ie, at the end of the lactation period or according to the
      expected calving date for heifers) and again 5 weeks later. The remaining 24
      cattle were not vaccinated (control group). Titers of SN antibodies were measured
      at the 5-week time point. Titers of SN and CN antibodies were measured at
      parturition. RESULTS: 5 weeks after initial vaccination, titers of SN antibodies 
      against BHV-1 and BVDV types 1 and 2 were 1:512, 1:128, and 1:2,048,
      respectively, in vaccinates and 1:64, 1:128, and 1:64, respectively, in
      unvaccinated controls. Equivalent SN antibody titers at parturition were 1:256,
      1:64, and 1:512, respectively, in vaccinates and 1:128, 1:128, and 1:64,
      respectively, in controls. Median titers of CN antibodies against BHV-1 and BVDV 
      types 1 and 2 were 1:1,280, 1:10,240, and 1:20,480, respectively, in vaccinates
      and 1:80, 1:1,280, and 1:2,560, respectively, in controls. CONCLUSIONS AND
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Titers of antibodies against viral respiratory pathogens were
      significantly enhanced in both serum (BHV-1 and BVDV type 2) and colostrum (BHV-1
      and BVDV types 1 and 2) in cattle receiving a killed virus vaccine (with no
      adverse reactions) before parturition. To maximize protection of bovine neonates,
      this method of vaccination should be considered.

TI  - Performance of growing cattle on poor-quality rangelands supplemented with
      farm-formulated protein supplements in Zimbabwe.
PG  - 905-12
LID - 10.1111/jpn.12303 [doi]
AB  - Farmers use different non-conventional protein supplements and different feeding 
      strategies to aid their animals survive the dry season in Zimbabwe. The
      strategies can be giving supplements once a week or once every other day up to
      very little supplement daily. Supplements are either legume crop residues or
      forage legumes. However, the efficacy of the use of non-conventional protein
      supplements in promoting growth and at the same time lowering the age at first
      calving is little understood. The study tested whether supplementing with
      farm-formulated non-conventional feeds could reduce live weight loss during the
      dry season and promote live weight gain as well as early development of sexual
      maturity in beef cattle. In a completely randomized design, thirty dams with
      calves on hooves were allocated to five different treatments which were repeated 
      during the dry season for 3 years. The 3-year study results show that weight loss
      can be controlled, resulting in positive growth in both the pre-weaning and
      post-weaning phases of growing cattle. Yearlings fed solely on natural pasture
      lost significant weight during the dry season as compared to supplemented groups.
      The period to puberty and first calving was achieved at 18 and 27 months,
      respectively. Using non-conventional protein supplements could thus improve
      livestock productivity in resource-poor farming communities. It was concluded
      that smallholder farmers can supplement cattle with a kilogram per day of
      low-cost farm-based non-conventional legume meal to improve livestock
      productivity in semi-arid regions of Zimbabwe.

TI  - Effects of narasin (Skycis) on live performance and carcass traits of finishing
      pigs sold in a three-phase marketing system.
PG  - 5028-35
LID - 10.2527/jas.2015-9314 [doi]
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effect of feeding narasin (Skycis; Elanco
      Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) on growth performance and carcass characteristics 
      of finishing pigs sold in a 3-phase marketing system. Pigs ( = 1,232) were housed
      in 56 single-sex pens (22 pigs/pen) divided into 2 even blocks based on
      initiation of treatment. Each treatment x sex combination was replicated 14
      times. Pigs were fed either 0 mg/kg narasin (control) or 15 mg/kg narasin for up 
      to 85 d of finishing (initiated at an average of 52.95 kg BW). In each pen, 18%
      (4 pigs per pen) of pigs were sold in the first marketing group (Day 64 of
      dietary treatment), 50% (11 of the original 22) were sold in the second marketing
      group (Day 78), and 32% (the remaining 7 pigs) were sold in the third marketing
      group (Day 85). Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with pen
      as the experimental unit. The model included the fixed effects of diet, sex, and 
      their interaction. Block and replicate nested within block were random variables.
      Carcass data from pigs in marketing group 3 of block 2 was not collected due to
      inclement weather. Narasin had no effect on growth performance traits ( >/= 0.15)
      in phases 1 (Days 1-28) or 2 (Days 29-56), regardless of sex. Barrows fed narasin
      had a 2.0% greater overall (Day 0-85) ADG than barrows fed the control diet ( <
      0.01), but ADG of gilts was not different due to diet ( = 0.69). Regardless of
      sex, narasin improved ( = 0.03) feed efficiency (G:F) by 1.3% throughout the 85-d
      feeding period. There were no effects ( >/= 0.21) of narasin on carcass
      composition in marketing groups 1 and 2. Narasin-fed barrows in marketing group 3
      had 0.9 percentage units lower ( < 0.01) estimated carcass lean compared with
      barrows fed control diets (51.0 vs. 52.0%); no difference existed in gilts ( =
      0.21). This is likely due to narasin-fed barrows of marketing group 3 tending ( =
      0.06) to have 7.7% greater fat depth than control barrows of marketing group 3.
      Pooled effects (across all 3 marketing groups) of feeding narasin tended ( =
      0.08) to reduce loin depth by 1.1% (60.00 vs. 60.66 mm), but there were no
      effects on fat depth ( = 0.24) or estimated carcass lean ( = 0.11). Overall,
      narasin can be used during the last 85 d of feeding to increase feed efficiency
      of barrows and gilts with minimal impact on carcass composition.

TI  - Benefits of repeated individual dietary counselling in long-term weight control
      in women after delivery.
PG  - 1041-8

AB  - As pregnancy may trigger overweight in women, new means for its prevention are
      being sought. The aim here was to investigate the effect of individual dietary
      counselling during and after pregnancy on post-partum weight and waist
      circumference up to 4 years post-partum. A cohort of women (n = 256) were
      randomized to receive repeated individual dietary counselling by a nutritionist
      during and after pregnancy, or as controls not receiving dietary counselling,
      from the first trimester of pregnancy until 6 months after delivery. Counselling 
      aimed to bring dietary intake into line with recommendations, with particular
      focus on the increase in the intake of unsaturated fatty acids instead of
      saturated. Pre-pregnancy weight was taken from welfare clinic records. Weight and
      waist circumference were measured at 4 years after delivery. The proportion of
      overweight women increased from 26% prior to pregnancy to 30% at 4 years after
      delivery among women receiving dietary counselling, as against considerably more,
      from 32% to 57%, among controls. The prevalence of central adiposity was 31% in
      women receiving dietary counselling, 64% in controls. Likewise, both the risk of 
      overweight (odds ratio: 0.23, 0.08-0.63, P = 0.005) and central adiposity (odds
      ratio: 0.18, 0.06-0.52, P = 0.002) were lower in women receiving dietary
      counselling compared with controls. Repeated dietary counselling initiated in
      early pregnancy can be beneficial in long-term weight control after delivery.

TI  - Roasted soybean supplements for finishing beef cattle on Brachiaria brizantha
      pasture.
PG  - 1233-9
LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0851-2 [doi]
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the inclusion of 0, 14, 27.5 and 41
      g/kg roasted soybean (RSB) in protein-energy supplements for the finishing of
      beef cattle on pastures of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu in the rainy period. 
      In experiment 1, for the evaluation of the nutritional parameters, five
      rumen-cannulated steers with an initial average body weight of 474.5 kg were
      utilised. In experiment 2, for the evaluation of performance, 25 intact male zebu
      cattle with an initial average body weight of 418 kg were utilised. Supply of RSB
      led to an increase in the intake of crude protein and non-fibre carbohydrates (P 
      < 0.05). The concentrations of rumen ammonia nitrogen increased significantly (P 
      < 0.05) 4 h after supplementation. The animals that received protein-energy
      supplements had superior (52 %) average daily gain in relation to those receiving
      mineral mixture. The supply of protein-energy supplements formulated with roasted
      soybean provided an increase in average daily weight gain and an improvement in
      the nutritional parameters of finishing beef cattle on pasture in the rainy
      period.

TI  - Performance and carcass yield of crossbred dairy steers fed diets with different 
      levels of concentrate.
PG  - 1307-12
LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0864-x [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of diets with
      increasing concentrate levels (170, 340, 510 and 680 g/kg of total dry matter) on
      dry matter intake, digestibility, performance and carcass characteristics of 25
      Holstein-Zebu crossbred dairy steers in a feedlot. A completely randomized design
      was used, and data were submitted to analysis of variance and regression. The dry
      matter intake and digestibility coefficients of all nutrients increased linearly.
      The total weight gain and average daily gain added 1.16 kg and 9.90 g,
      respectively, for each 10 g/kg increase in concentrate. The empty body weight,
      hot carcass weight and cold carcass weight responded linearly to increasing
      concentrate. The hot carcass yield and cold carcass yield, gains in empty body
      weight and carcass gain were also influenced, as were the efficiencies of carcass
      deposition and carcass deposition rate. It is concluded that increasing
      concentrate levels in feedlot diets increase the intake and digestibility of dry 
      matter and other nutrients, improving the feed efficiency, performance and
      physical characteristics of the carcass. Furthermore and of importance concerning
      the climate change debate, evidence from the literature indicates that enteric
      methane production would be reduced with increasing concentrate levels such as
      those used.

AB  - Children's learning about food is considerable during their formative years, with
      parental influence being pivotal. Research has focused predominantly on maternal 
      influences, with little known about the relationships between fathers' and
      children's diets. Greater understanding of this relationship is necessary for the
      design of appropriate interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      associations between the diets of fathers and their children and the moderating
      effects of fathers' BMI, education and age on these associations. The diets of
      fathers and their first-born children (n 317) in the Melbourne Infant Feeding
      Activity and Nutrition Trial (InFANT) Program were assessed using an FFQ and 3 x 
      24-h recalls, respectively. The InFANT Program is a cluster-randomised controlled
      trial in the setting of first-time parents groups in Victoria, Australia.
      Associations between father and child fruit, vegetable, non-core food and
      non-core drink intakes were assessed using linear regression. The extent to which
      these associations were mediated by maternal intake was tested. Moderation of
      associations by paternal BMI, education and age was assessed. Positive
      associations were found between fathers' and children's intake of fruit, sweet
      snacks and take-away foods. Paternal BMI, education and age moderated the
      relationships found for the intakes of fruit (BMI), vegetables (age), savoury
      snacks (BMI and education) and take-away foods (BMI and education). Our findings 
      suggest that associations exist at a young age and are moderated by paternal BMI,
      education and age. This study highlights the importance of fathers in modelling
      healthy diets for their children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Food insecurity and HIV/AIDS outcomes are inextricably linked in
      sub-Saharan Africa. We report on health and nutritional outcomes of a
      multisectoral agricultural intervention trial among HIV-infected adults in rural 
      Kenya. DESIGN: This is a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The 
      intervention included a human-powered water pump, a microfinance loan to purchase
      farm commodities, and education in sustainable farming practices and financial
      management. Two health facilities in Nyanza Region, Kenya were randomly assigned 
      as intervention or control. HIV-infected adults 18 to 49 years' old who were on
      antiretroviral therapy and had access to surface water and land were enrolled
      beginning in April 2012 and followed quarterly for 1 year. Data were collected on
      nutritional parameters, CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, and HIV RNA. Differences in
      fixed-effects regression models were used to test whether patterns in health
      outcomes differed over time from baseline between the intervention and control
      arms. RESULTS: We enrolled 72 and 68 participants in the intervention and control
      groups, respectively. At 12 months follow-up, we found a statistically
      significant increase in CD4 cell counts (165 cells/mul, P < 0.001) and proportion
      virologically suppressed in the intervention arm compared with the control arm
      (comparative improvement in proportion of 0.33 suppressed, odds ratio 7.6, 95%
      confidence interval: 2.2-26.8). Intervention participants experienced significant
      improvements in food security (3.6 scale points higher, P < 0.001) and frequency 
      of food consumption (9.4 times per week greater frequency, P = 0.013) compared to
      controls. CONCLUSION: Livelihood interventions may be a promising approach to
      tackle the intersecting problems of food insecurity, poverty and HIV/AIDS
      morbidity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The quantity and quality of essential oils in plants can be
      influenced by various factors, including genetic traits, agricultural practices
      and environmental conditions such as nutrient availability. Macronutrients such
      as sulfur (S) are among the major factors influencing plant growth and
      development. Therefore this study was carried out to determine the effect of S
      fertilization at three levels (0, 0.05 and 0.1 g S kg(-1) soil) on the essential 
      oil composition and antioxidant activity of Satureja hortensis L. RESULTS:
      Application of 0.05 g S kg(-1) soil increased the levels of alpha-terpinene,
      p-cymene, myrcene, alpha-thujene and alpha-pinene but decreased the level of
      gamma-terpinene in the essential oil. This S application was most suitable for
      obtaining higher proportions of alpha-terpinene, p-cymene, myrcene, alpha-thujene
      and alpha-pinene, while application of 0.1 g S kg(-1) soil was preferable for
      carvacrol. gamma-Terpinene was most abundant in the control. All extracts showed 
      a considerable DPPH-inhibitory effect, with IC50 ranging from 0.720 g L(-1) in
      the control to 0.363 g L(-1) with application of 0.1 g S kg(-1) soil. The maximum
      antioxidant effect was observed with application of 0.1 g S kg(-1) soil.
      CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the use of chemical fertilizers such as S
      could improve the antioxidant activity of plant extracts significantly. Studying 
      the secondary plant metabolites, mainly essential oils, is an interesting
      research area, so further studies are recommended to determine the effect of
      chemical fertilizers on the composition and antioxidant activity of essential
      oils of other aromatic plants.

TI  - Haematological effects of 2-phenoxyethanol and etomidate in carp (Cyprinus carpio
      L.).
PG  - 537-46

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of handling alone versus handling under
      anaesthesia with 2-phenoxyethanol or etomidate on haematological parameters in
      carp. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, laboratory experiment. ANIMALS:
      Seventy-two juvenile carp (Cyprinus carpio) weighing 35.9 +/- 10.4 g were divided
      into six groups of 12 fish. METHODS: Either 2-phenoxyethanol or 2% etomidate were
      administered to induce deep anaesthesia (0.3 mL L(-1) and 0.6 mL L(-1) ,
      respectively) or deep sedation (0.15 mL L(-1) and 0.3 mL L(-1) , respectively).
      Fish were handled with and without sedation. Blood was sampled at 1 hour and 1
      week post-treatment. Phagocyte oxidative activity [nitrotetrazolium blue
      reduction test (NBT)] and differential erythrocyte [red blood cell (RBC)] and
      leukocyte (white blood cell) counts were evaluated. RESULTS: At 1 hour after the 
      induction of anaesthesia, haematocrit (Ht) and haemoglobin (Hb) were increased in
      fish anaesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) 
      was increased in fish anaesthetized with etomidate. At 1 week, an increase in
      RBC, erythroblastosis, erythrocyte damage, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, monocytosis
      and thrombocytosis occurred in both groups. Red blood parameters did not change 1
      hour after handling alone, but after 1 week Ht, Hb and mean cell volume
      decreased, whereas MCH concentration (MCHC) and abnormal erythrocytes increased. 
      Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, monocytosis, thrombocytosis and a decrease in NBT
      occurred. Fish handled under sedation showed an increase in Hb and MCHC followed 
      by a decrease at 1 week in Ht, Hb and MCH, erythroblastosis and increased
      abnormal erythrocytes. Lymphopenia and neutrophilia were less pronounced than in 
      fish handled without sedation, but a decrease in NBT was noted at 1 week
      post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Deep anaesthesia with
      2-phenoxyethanol or etomidate induced significant haematological alterations in
      juvenile carp. Deep sedation reduced the immediate immunosuppressive effects of
      handling but did not eliminate longterm effects. These anaesthetics should be
      avoided during experimental procedures involving haematological measurements. In 
      contexts that require the short-term handling of carp, these drugs should be used
      with caution in view of their possible side effects.

TI  - Confinement of sows for different periods during lactation: effects on behaviour 
      and lesions of sows and performance of piglets.
PG  - 1373-8
LID - 10.1017/S1751731115000889 [doi]
AB  - Alternatives to farrowing crates with continuous confinement of the sow are
      urgently needed because the animal welfare is negatively impacted. Given the
      increase of herd sizes, practical experience with loose-housing is needed to
      force the implementation of these systems in the field. Next to aspects of labour
      efficiency, detrimental piglet mortality rates that may occur during the first
      days postpartum (pp) is a major criticism. Therefore, loose-housing after a
      crating period limited to the first days pp might be a feasible alternative to
      improve welfare under intensive production conditions. The aim was to investigate
      the effect of crating sows during lactation for different periods on their
      behaviour and integument alterations and on piglets' performance. Gilts from a
      commercial herd were observed from 5 to 26 days pp and housed in farrowing crates
      (1.85x2.50 m) that could be altered between confinement crates and loose-housing 
      pens. Animals were divided into three groups, that were either crated
      continuously from birth until weaning (Group A, n=55), until 14 days pp (Group B;
      n=54) or 7 days pp (Group C, n=59). The behaviour of six randomly selected gilts 
      per group was video recorded from 5 to 26 days pp and analysed by time sampling
      technique. Lesions on the legs, shoulder and lumbar vertebra were scored on days 
      7, 14 and 25 pp. Piglets were weighed weekly, causes of losses recorded and
      weight losses of gilts measured. Not different between groups (P>0.05), animals
      spent 72 to 76% lying laterally, 14 to 17% lying in abdominal or semi-abdominal
      position, 9 to 10% standing and 1 to 3% sitting. B-sows were lying longer in week
      3 and 4 of lactation compared to A- and C-sows (P0.05), whereas almost 90% of the
      losses occurred in the first week pp. In conclusion, loose-housing of lactating
      gilts after a reduced postnatal crating period of 7 days affected neither the
      activity level of the gilts and lesions on the integument nor pre-weaning
      mortality. Therefore, it is recommended to allow sows to move around to some
      extent during the later lactation period.

TI  - Requirement of standardized ileal digestible valine to lysine ratio for 8- to
      14-kg pigs.
PG  - 1312-8
LID - 10.1017/S1751731115000695 [doi]
AB  - The objective was to define the Val requirement for weaned piglets in the context
      of reducing the dietary protein content. A dose-response experiment was conducted
      to estimate the standardized ileal digestible (SID) Val to Lys ratio required to 
      support the optimum growth of post-weaned piglets. In this study, 96 pigs
      weighing 8 kg were allotted to one of six dietary treatments (16 pigs for each
      dietary treatment) and were housed individually. Diets were formulated to provide
      0.58, 0.62, 0.66, 0.70, 0.74 and 0.78 SID Val : Lys by adding graded levels of
      crystalline l-Val to the 0.58 SID Val : Lys diet. Lysine was sub-limiting and
      supplied 90% of the recommendation (10.95 g SID Lys/kg equal to 11.8 g/kg total
      Lys). Average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed
      ratio (G : F) were determined during a 14-day period of ad libitum feeding. Blood
      and urine samples were taken at the end of each week (day 7 and 14 of the
      experiment) 3 h after feeding the experimental diets. The maximum ADFI and ADG
      were obtained in pigs fed the 0.78 SID Val : Lys diet; it was not different from 
      the results of pigs fed 0.70 SID Val : Lys diet. The highest G : F was obtained
      in pigs fed 0.70 SID Val : Lys. The plasma concentration of Val increased
      linearly (P<0.001) as the dietary SID Val : Lys increased. The increasing dietary
      Val : Lys also resulted in a linear increase in Cys (P<0.001) and a quadratic
      increase in Arg (P=0.003), Lys (P=0.05) and Phe (P=0.009). The plasma Gly showed 
      a quadratic decrease (P=0.05) as the dietary Val : Lys increased. Neither plasma 
      nor urinary urea to creatinine ratio was affected by treatment. The minimum SID
      Val : Lys required to maximize ADFI, ADG and G : F was estimated at 0.67 SID Val 
      : Lys by a broken-line model, and at 0.71 SID Val : Lys by a curvilinear plateau 
      model. The Val deficiency caused a reduction in ADFI, and Val supplementation
      above the requirement did not impair animal performance. In conclusion, 0.70 SID 
      Val : Lys is suggested as the Val requirement for 8 to 14 kg individually housed 
      pigs.

TI  - Use of re-esterified palm oils, differing in their acylglycerol structure, in
      weaning-piglet diets.
PG  - 1304-11
LID - 10.1017/S1751731115000622 [doi]
AB  - Re-esterified oils are new fat sources obtained from chemical esterification of
      acid oils with glycerol (both economically interesting by-products from oil
      refining and biodiesel industries, respectively). The different fatty acid (FA)
      positional distribution and acylglycerol composition of re-esterified oils may
      enhance the apparent absorption of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and, thus, their
      overall nutritive value. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      potential use of re-esterified palm oils, in comparison with their corresponding 
      acid and native oils, and also with an unsaturated fat source in weaning-piglet
      diets. The parameters assessed were: FA apparent absorption, acylglycerol and
      free fatty acid (FFA) composition of feces, and growth performance. One-hundred
      and twenty weaning piglets (average weight of 8.50+/-1.778 kg) were blocked by
      initial BW (six blocks) and randomly assigned to five dietary treatments,
      resulting in four piglets per pen and six replicates per treatment. Dietary
      treatments were a basal diet supplemented with 10% (as-fed basis) of native
      soybean oil (SN), native palm oil (PN), acid palm oil (PA), re-esterified palm
      oil low in mono- (MAG) and diacylglycerols (DAG) (PEL), or re-esterified palm oil
      high in MAG and DAG (PEH). Results from the digestibility balance showed that SN 
      reached the greatest total FA apparent absorption, and statistically different
      from PN, PA and PEL (P0.05), but PEH achieved the greatest total FA apparent
      absorption. Animals fed PEL, despite the fact that PEL oil contained more sn-2
      SFA, did not show an improved absorption of SFA (P>0.05). Animals fed PA and PN
      showed similar apparent absorption coefficients (P>0.05), despite the high FFA
      content of PA oil. The acylglycerol and FFA composition of feces was mainly
      composed of FFA. There were no significant differences in growth performance
      (P>0.05). Results of the present study suggest that, despite the different
      acylglycerol structure of re-esterified oils, there were no significant
      differences in digestibility or performance with respect to their corresponding
      PN and PA oils in weaning-piglet diets.

AB  - Sensory quality of pork is a complex phenotype determined by interactions between
      genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed at describing the respective 
      influences of breed and production system on the development of pork quality.
      Plasma stress indicators and Longissimus muscle (LM) composition, physicochemical
      and sensory quality traits were determined in two contrasted breeds - the
      conventional Large White (LW, n=40) and the French local Basque (B, n=60). Pigs
      were reared in either a conventional (C; n=20 per breed), alternative (A; sawdust
      bedding and outdoor area, n=20 per breed) or extensive system (E; free-range,
      n=20 B). All the pigs from A and C systems were slaughtered at the same
      slaughterhouse, whereas B pigs from the E system were slaughtered at a local
      commercial abattoir. Major breed differences were found for almost all traits
      under study. LM from B pigs exhibited higher lipid, lower water and collagen
      concentrations, as well as lower collagen thermal solubility (P0.05) influence
      plasma stress indicators, LM chemical composition and physicochemical or sensory 
      traits of pork. In contrast, within the B pigs, the E system affected the meat
      quality more. Lower plasma cortisol levels (P<0.05), but higher plasma lactate,
      creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities, and more skin lesions
      (P<0.05), indicating higher muscular activity during pre-slaughter handling, were
      found in pigs produced in the E compared with the C system. E pigs exhibited
      higher meat pH1 and pHu values and shear force (P<0.01) and exhibited lower
      lightness, hue angle and drip and thawing losses (P<0.01) compared with the C
      pigs, whereas LM lipid, protein or collagen concentrations were not affected.
      Regarding sensory traits, the E system produced redder meat, but did not impact
      the eating quality of pork. Altogether, this study demonstrates that differences 
      in meat quality between B and LW breeds can be modulated by extensive pig
      production system.

TI  - Does the environmental background (intensive v. outdoor systems) influence the
      behaviour of piglets at weaning?
PG  - 1361-72
LID - 10.1017/S1751731115000531 [doi]
AB  - Under intensive pig husbandry, outdoor systems offer a more complex physical and 
      social environment compared with indoor systems (farrowing sheds). As the rearing
      environment affects behavioural development, it can, therefore, influence
      behavioural responses of pigs to stressful environments in later stages of
      production. We tested how the rearing environment influenced behavioural
      responses to a novel arena test in piglets on the day that they were weaned and
      mixed into large groups. We recorded video footage and compared the behavioural
      responses of 30 outdoor-raised and 30 farrowing shed-raised piglets tested in an 
      experimental arena and sequentially exposed to four challenges (each for 5 min)
      on the day of weaning. Quantitative and qualitative behavioural measures were
      recorded using time budgets and scoring demeanour or 'qualitative behavioural
      expression' (using Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA)). When held in
      isolation (challenge 1), both groups were scored as more 'scared/worried', while 
      outdoor-raised piglets spent more time eating and jumping against the arena
      walls. Both groups interacted with a plastic ball (challenge 2: exposure to a
      novel object) during which they were scored as more 'playful/curious' than other 
      challenges. When a food bowl was introduced (challenge 3), farrowing shed-raised 
      piglets were more interested in playing with the food bowl itself, whereas
      outdoor-raised piglets spent more time eating the feed. Finally, there were no
      significant differences in social behaviour (challenge 4: introduction of another
      piglet) between the two groups in terms of the latency to contact each other,
      amount of time recorded engaged in aggressive/non-aggressive social interactions 
      or QBA scores. Although piglets spent 30% of their time interacting with the
      other piglet, and half of this time (47%) was engaged in negative interactions
      (pushing, biting), the levels of aggression were not different between the two
      groups. Overall, outdoor-raised piglets ate more and were scored as more
      'calm/passive', whereas farrowing shed-raised piglets spent more time
      investigating their environment and were scored as more 'playful/inquisitive'. In
      conclusion, we did not find differences in behaviour between outdoor-raised and
      farrowing shed-raised piglets that would highlight welfare issues. The
      differences found in this study may reflect conflicting affective states, with
      responses to confinement, neophobia and motivation for exploration evident.

AB  - Involvement of children in gardening has the potential to increase liking of
      fruit and vegetables (FV) and consequently, intake, but research results are
      mixed. School gardening led by external specialists such as the Royal
      Horticultural Society (RHS) could have more impact than teacher-led gardening on 
      children's knowledge of, and attitudes towards, FV. Data from a cluster
      randomised controlled trial were used to compare a RHS-led school gardening
      intervention with a teacher-led gardening intervention amongst 7-10 year olds in 
      21 London schools. A short questionnaire was developed and used to identify
      children's knowledge and attitudes towards FV consumption before the garden
      intervention and 18 months afterwards. Results from multilevel regression models,
      both unadjusted and adjusted for baseline responses and socio-demographic
      factors, were reported. Attitudes to FV intake were compared between groups.
      Change in FV knowledge was used to predict change in FV consumption assessed
      using 24-hour food diaries. In comparison with the RHS-led group (n = 373),
      teacher-led children (n = 404) were more likely to agree they ate lots of fruit
      (p < 0.009) and tried new fruits (p = 0.045), but RHS-led gardening was
      associated with a greater increase in the total number of vegetables recognised
      (p = 0.031). No other differences in improvements in attitudes, or associations
      between change in FV recognition and intake were found. In relation to
      improvements in children's recognition and attitudes towards eating FV, this
      trial produced limited evidence that gardening activity packages led by external 
      specialists (RHS-led) provide additional benefits over those led by teachers
      trained by the RHS. Indeed, the latter were potentially more effective.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of weight gain of calves
      within the first 3 weeks of life on health status and subsequent performance.
      Holstein bull calves were reared either intensively (IR; individual hutches and
      ad libitum milk feeding for the first 3 weeks of life; n = 24), or according to
      the established protocol [ER; 4 l milk/day in hutches during week 1 and 720 g/day
      milk replacer (MR) from day 8 to 21 in a group pen; n = 24]. Water, hay and
      concentrates were freely available to all calves. From week 4, calves of both
      groups were housed together in a group pen and fed 720 g MR/day; step-down
      weaning was performed between week 5 and 10. Key metabolic blood parameters were 
      analysed on day 2, 12, 21 and 70 of life. After weaning, all animals were fed
      concentrates and corn silage until slaughter at an age of 8 months. Within the
      first 3 weeks, average daily weight gain was threefold higher in IR calves in
      relation to ER calves (1.28 vs. 0.38 kg/day, p < 0.001). Neither incidence nor
      duration of scouring differed significantly between groups. Starter intake (week 
      4-10) was higher in IR calves in relation to ER calves (49.7 vs. 38.0 kg/calf, p 
      = 0.006). Serum glucose, urea, albumin and insulin were higher at an age of 21
      days in IR calves in relation to ER calves; no differences were obvious at an age
      of 70 days. Plasma GH and IGF-I concentrations revealed an uncoupling of the
      somatotropic axis in ER calves within the first 3 weeks of life. At slaughter,
      body weight of IR calves tended to be higher than that of the ER calves (320 vs. 
      309 kg, p = 0.07). In conclusion, intensive feeding and individual housing during
      the first 3 weeks of life had positive long-term effects on subsequent
      performance.

      finishing pigs.
PG  - 4172-80
LID - 10.2527/jas.2015-9028 [doi]
AB  - Three experiments were conducted to determine the effects of feeder adjustment
      and diet form on growth performance of nursery (Exp. 1 and 2) and finishing (Exp.
      3) pigs. Treatments were arranged as a 2 x 3 factorial with the main effects of
      feeder adjustment and diet form. The 2 feeder adjustments were a narrow and wide 
      feeder adjustment (minimum gap opening of 1.27 and 2.54 cm, respectively). The 3 
      diet forms were meal, poor-quality pellets (70% pellets and 30% fines for Exp. 1 
      and 2 and 50% pellets and 50% fines for Exp. 3), and screened pellets with
      minimal fines (3 to 10%). In Exp. 1, 210 pigs (initially 11.9 kg BW) were used in
      a 21-d trial with 7 pigs per pen and 5 pens per treatment. No feeder adjustment x
      diet form interactions were observed. There were no differences in ADG, ADFI, or 
      G:F due to feeder adjustment. Pigs fed the meal diet had increased ( < 0.05) ADG 
      and ADFI compared with pigs fed the poor-quality or screened pellets. Pigs fed
      meal or poor-quality pellets had decreased ( < 0.05) G:F compared with pigs fed
      screened pellets. In Exp. 2, 1,005 nursery pigs (initially 14.1 kg BW) were used 
      in a 28-d trial with 26 to 28 pigs per pen and 6 pens per treatment. Pigs fed
      from the narrow feeder adjustment had decreased ( < 0.05) ADG and ADFI compared
      with pigs fed from the wide adjustment with no differences in G:F. Pigs fed the
      meal diet had decreased ( < 0.05) ADG compared with pigs fed poor-quality or
      screened pellets. Pigs fed meal or poor-quality pellets had decreased ( < 0.05)
      G:F compared with pigs fed screened pellets. In Exp. 3, 246 pigs (initially 56.8 
      kg BW) were used in a 69-d trial with 5 pens per treatment and 6 or 7 pigs per
      pen. Overall, ADFI decreased ( < 0.05) and G:F increased ( < 0.05) for pigs fed
      from the narrow adjusted feeders compared with the wide adjustment with no
      differences in ADG. Overall, pigs fed meal diets tended to have decreased ( <
      0.10) ADG and had decreased ( < 0.05) G:F compared with pigs fed screened
      pellets; ADG and G:F in those fed poor-quality pellets were intermediate. Feeding
      meal or poor-quality pellets increased ( < 0.05) ADFI compared with pigs fed
      screened pellets. In conclusion, feeding nursery pigs from a wide feeder gap may 
      increase ADG and ADFI with no negative effects on G:F. For finishing pigs,
      reducing feeder gap reduced feed disappearance and improved G:F. In all
      experiments, the greatest G:F improvements from pelleting were observed when the 
      percentage of fines was minimized.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of peripartum feed supplementation on doe and
      kid BW and BCS, milk yield and composition, serum metabolites, and
      maternal-neonatal behavior under rangeland conditions in northern Mexico. Adult
      does ( = 23) were randomly assigned to 3 nutritional plane groups: 1) goats
      supplemented (500 g of concentrate [18% CP/kg DM, 2.7 Mcal/kg DM, and 2% salt])
      from 15 d prepartum to 7 d postpartum (G15; = 8), 2) the same supplementation as 
      G15 but from 35 d before until 7 d after kidding (G35; = 8), and 3)
      nonsupplemented does (GC; = 7). Supplemented goats differed from GC goats in BW
      (48 +/- 1.8, 46.1 +/- 2.5, and 44.9 +/- 2.3 kg; < 0.05), milk yield (1.8 +/- 0.1,
      1.9 +/- 0.2, and 1.2 +/- 0.1 kg at d 15 postpartum; < 0.01), kid birth weights
      (3.8 +/- 0.2, 3.6 +/- 0.2, and 3.4 +/- 0.2 kg; < 0.05), and kid BW at 15 d after 
      birth (6.9 +/- 0.2, 6.6 +/- 0.2, and 5.6 +/- 0.2 kg; < 0.05) for the G35, G15,
      and GC, respectively. Serum concentrations for total protein, glucose, and
      cholesterol were not affected ( > 0.05) by treatments. Milk of GC goats showed
      increased ( < 0.05) percentages for fat, protein, lactose, and nonfat milk
      solids, whereas total quantities of these variables where higher ( < 0.05) in the
      G15 and G35 groups. Furthermore, GC dams spent more time seeking their offspring 
      and emitted more low-pitched bleats 4 h postpartum ( < 0.05) in a 2-choice test
      compared with the G15 and G35 groups. In general, peripartum supplementation
      promoted a closer dam-kid relationship at 8 h postpartum. Goat performance may be
      improved in this semiarid region of Mexico with marginal production through
      supplementation in late gestation.

TI  - The effect of a limit-fed diet and slow-feed hay nets on morphometric
      measurements and postprandial metabolite and hormone patterns in adult horses.
PG  - 4144-52
LID - 10.2527/jas.2015-9150 [doi]
AB  - Modern horse management systems tend to limit a horse's opportunity to forage,
      rely on meal feeding, and may contribute to the increase in equine obesity. The
      use of slow-feed hay nets represents an opportunity to extend foraging time while
      feeding a restricted diet. The objectives of this study were to determine if
      limit feeding combined with a slow-feed hay net would affect morphometric
      measurements and postprandial metabolite and hormone patterns in overweight adult
      horses. Eight adult Quarter horses (BW 563 kg +/- 4.6 kg; BCS 7.2 +/- 0.3) were
      used in a randomized complete block design, with 4 horses assigned to feeding hay
      off the stall floor (FLOOR) and 4 horses assigned to feeding from a slow-feed hay
      net (NET). Horses were fed in individual stalls at 1% BW each day, split evenly
      between 2 meals at 0700 and 1600 h. Body weight, BCS, neck and girth
      circumference, cresty neck score, and ultrasound measurements of average rump
      fat, longissimus dorsi (LD) depth, and LD thickness were taken on d 0, 14, and
      28. Three 24-h blood samplings were conducted on d 0, 14, and 28 and were
      analyzed for glucose, insulin, cortisol, and leptin concentrations. Samplings
      occurred every 30 min for 3 h postfeeding, with hourly samples occurring between 
      feedings. Horses feeding from the FLOOR took less time to consume their hay meal 
      compared with horses feeding from the NET ( < 0.001). All horses lost weight over
      the 28-d period ( < 0.0001); however, no difference was observed between
      treatments. There was no difference in BCS, neck and girth circumference, cresty 
      neck score, rump fat, or LD depth between days or treatments ( >/= 0.25). There
      was an effect of day on LD thickness in horses feeding from the NET. Longissimus 
      dorsi thickness was lower on d 28 compared with that on d 0 ( = 0.0257). Only
      time to peak insulin and peak cortisol were affected by treatment ( </= 0.037),
      with horses feeding from the NET having lower values than horses feeding from the
      FLOOR. Average glucose, insulin, cortisol, and leptin were affected by day ( </= 
      0.0102). Glucose and insulin values increased, whereas cortisol and leptin levels
      decreased throughout the 28-d study. The use of a slow-feed hay net coupled with 
      a limit-fed diet appears to be an effective method for decreasing BW and
      maintaining more homeostatic levels of postprandial metabolites and hormones when
      feeding overweight adult horses.

      mortality.
PG  - 4079-88
LID - 10.2527/jas.2015-8973 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate piglet mortality in a commercial
      setting where sows were accommodated in a loose-housed system with an option to
      confine the sow for a few days around farrowing and during early lactation. The
      study was conducted in a Danish piggery where records were obtained from 2,139
      farrowings. Sows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments: loose-loose (LL), 
      loose-confined (LC), and confined-confined (CC). In LL, sows were loose housed
      from the time they entered the farrowing pens to weaning. In LC, sows were loose 
      housed until farrowing was finished and then confined to d 4 after farrowing. In 
      CC, sows were confined at d 114 of gestation to d 4 after farrowing. All sows
      were loose housed from d 5 to weaning. Total piglet mortality was analyzed at
      batch level to include piglets fostered by nurse sows and at sow level to analyze
      the effects of confinement during different time periods. Total piglet mortality 
      was greater in LL (26.0%) and LC (25.4%) compared with CC (22.1%; < 0.001). The
      proportion of stillborn piglets was not different between treatments ( = 0.21)
      but a larger proportion was crushed in LL (10.7%) compared with LC (9.7%; =
      0.03), which again was greater than CC (7.8%; < 0.001). Piglet mortality before
      equalization was lower in CC (3.7%) than in LL (7.5%) and LC (7.0%; < 0.001).
      Confinement reduced mortality from litter equalization to d 4 (7.6% for LL vs.
      6.7% for LC; = 0.01) but more so in CC (5.6%) than in LC ( < 0.001). From d 4 to 
      weaning, LL had lower mortality (5.6%) than LC (6.9%) and CC (6.6%; = 0.01). A
      larger proportion of sows in CC were classified as "low mortality" compared with 
      LL and LC both before ( < 0.001) and after ( = 0.002) litter equalization. The
      results in this study emphasize that the period of time from the birth of the
      first piglet to litter equalization is important in relation to piglet mortality.
      The results also suggest that confinement for 4 d after farrowing can reduce
      mortality in this specific period, but only confinement from d 114 of gestation
      to d 4 after farrowing reduced total piglet mortality.

AB  - Diet can influence both the qualitative and quantitative traits of ruminant meat.
      This study evaluated the effects of castor de-oiled cake on the meat of
      mixed-breed male goat kids. After 165days of diet treatment, no alterations
      (p>0.05) were observed in the in vivo performance, anatomic components,
      dissection and proximate composition of the Longissimus dorsi muscle, as well as 
      in the color and pH of the carcasses. However, diet had an effect (p<0.05) on
      energy metabolites, fatty acid profile, and expression of certain proteins of the
      Longissimus dorsi muscle. To conclude, this study showed that the establishment
      of castor de-oiled cake diet for a long period to goats led to alterations in
      meat quality, without compromising its consumption qualities.

AB  - High stocking density (STD) could affect duck welfare and production. The
      objective of our study was to investigate whether dietary tryptophan (TRP)
      supplementation could alleviate the detrimental effects of high STD on ducks.
      White Pekin ducks at 4 to 6 wk of age were raised at 11 birds/m(2) and fed diets 
      containing 0.18, 0.48, 0.78, or 1.08% TRP for 21 d. Growth performance,
      concentrations of TRP and metabolites in the blood and hypothalamus,
      antioxidative activities in serum and tissue, meat quality, serum uric acid, and 
      urea nitrogen were measured. Weight gain and feed efficiency were significantly
      improved by TRP supplementation at >/= 0.48 and >/= 0.78% (P < 0.05 and P <
      0.001, respectively). Serum TRP, hypothalamic TRP, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT),
      5-hydroxyindoleacitic acid (5-HIAA), and 5-HIAA/5-HT were also increased
      significantly (P < 0.01). These increases plateaued at 0.48% TRP, and no further 
      improvement was obtained by adding more TRP to the diet. Dietary TRP
      supplementation significantly increased levels of total antioxidant capacity,
      glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) in serum; GSH-Px in liver;
      and GSH-Px and CAT in breast muscle (P < 0.05). Malondialdehyde levels in breast 
      muscle decreased (P < 0.001). Drip loss of breast muscle and pH decline at 45 min
      postmortem were reduced by TRP supplementation (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05,
      respectively). Meat color was similar among different treatments (P > 0.05).
      Breast muscle shear force was increased significantly when dietary TRP level
      increased to 1.08% (P < 0.01). For ducks raised at 11 birds/m(2), dietary TRP
      supplementation could alleviate stress and improve growth performance,
      antioxidative activity, and meat quality.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of five feeding strategies
      on calf weaning weight, and cow milk production and composition in Brazilian
      Holstein x Zebu cows. A total of 60 cows and their calves were allocated to each 
      of five treatments. Cows in treatments 1, 2 and 3 were milked for 270 days and
      cows in treatments 4 and 5 were milked for 180 days. Calves in treatment 1 (CON) 
      were not supplemented with concentrate whereas calves from treatment 2 (CLPN)
      received 1 kg of concentrate daily from 90 to 270 days of age and calves from
      treatment 3 received 1 kg of concentrated from 180 to 270 days of age. Calves in 
      treatment 4 (CCPS) were supplemented with 1 kg of concentrate from 90 to 180 days
      of age and calves in treatment 5 (CLPS) were supplemented with 1 kg of
      concentrate from 90 to 270 days of age. Calves from the CLPS treatment had
      greater milk and protein intakes (P < 0.05) and greater growth rate than calves
      from the other treatments. Our results indicate that the traditional system of
      feeding calves with no concentrate results in a weight gain of 600 g/day. The
      CLPS treatment produced calves with the highest live weight and growth rate. The 
      nutritional strategy with restricted supply of milk for the calves with
      concomitantly short-term concentrate supplementation does not improve performance
      of calves but did increase feed costs.

AB  - The effect of browse plants (Piliostigma thonningii, Daniellia oliveri, Afzelia
      africana, Pterocarpus erinaceus and Annona senegalensis) supplementation on
      nutrient intake, digestibility, nutritive value and N utilization and growth
      performance of buckling goats fed threshed sorghum top (TST) was investigated
      using 24 Red Sokoto goats (9.0 +/- 0.25 kg) body weight (BW) which were randomly 
      assigned to one of the six diets in a completely random design. Intakes of dry
      matter (DM) and nutrients, feed conversion ratio, digestibility of nutrients
      except for neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF),
      digestible organic matter (DOM), digestible crude protein (DCP), energy
      concentration, N utilization and average daily gain were superior (P < 0.05) in
      TST-supplemented diets compared to sole TST diet. Among the supplemental fodders,
      intakes of forage, DM, condensed tannins and most of the nutrients; digestibility
      of DM, crude protein (CP) and non-fibre carbohydrate, DOM and DCP; and N
      absorbed, balance and retention were greater (P < 0.05) in A. africana relative
      to the other fodders. Results indicate that the entire browse fodders are good
      supplements to low quality TST, though A. africana appears to have a better
      nutritive value.

AB  - To assess the potential transmission for zoonotic influenza, sero-antibodies
      against two kinds of influenza viruses--classical swine H1N1 and human H1N1pdm09 
      virus were detected in persons whose profession involved contact with swine in
      Guangdong province, China. Compared to the non-exposed control group, a
      significantly higher proportion of subjects with occupational contact to pigs
      exhibited positive seroreaction against the classical H1N1 SIV. Participants aged
      26-50 years were at high risk of classic swine H1N1 infections. Seropositive rate
      to 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus among swine workers was similar with controls. The
      major impact of age was apparent for younger populations. Our present study has
      documented evidence for swine influenza virus infection among persons with
      occupational swine exposures. The differences of seroreactivity for the two
      tested influenza subtypes emphasize the necessity of regular surveillance both in
      pigs and human.

AB  - We evaluate the productivity effects of investment in preventive health
      technology through a randomized controlled trial in rural Zambia. In the
      experiment, access to subsidized bed nets was randomly assigned at the community 
      level; 516 farmers were followed over a one-year farming period. We find large
      positive effects of preventative health investment on productivity: among farmers
      provided with access to free nets, harvest value increased by US$ 76,
      corresponding to about 14.7% of the average output value. While only limited
      information was collected on farming inputs, shifts in the extensive and the
      intensive margins of labor supply appear to be the most likely mechanism
      underlying the productivity improvements observed.

TI  - Production benefits from pre- and post-lambing anthelmintic treatment of ewes on 
      commercial farms in the southern North Island of New Zealand.
PG  - 211-9
LID - 10.1080/00480169.2015.1007108 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To measure the magnitude and variability in production responses to
      anthelmintic treatments administered to adult ewes around lambing. METHODS: Ewes 
      carrying twin lambs, from sheep and beef farms (eight in Year 1 and six in Year
      2) in the Wairarapa region of New Zealand, were enrolled in 14 trials (part of an
      experiment carried out on one farm in one year). Experiment 1 compared ewes
      treated 2-4 weeks pre-lambing with a controlled release capsule (CRC) containing 
      abamectin, albendazole, Se and Co, to ewes injected pre-lambing with a
      long-acting Se plus vitamin B12 product, and to untreated ewes. Experiment 2
      included these treatments, plus a CRC administered at pregnancy scanning.
      Experiment 3 included the same treatments as Experiment 1, plus administration of
      a CRC containing albendazole, Se and Co, injectable moxidectin or oral derquantel
      plus abamectin, all administered pre-lambing, or oral derquantel plus abamectin
      administered 4-6 weeks after lambing. Variables compared were ewe liveweight at
      weaning and pre-mating, lamb liveweight at weaning, total weight of lamb weaned
      per ewe and ewe dag score at weaning. RESULTS: Ewes treated with a CRC
      pre-lambing were heavier than untreated ewes (mean 3.2 kg) at weaning in 12/14
      trials, and pre-mating (mean 2.8 kg) in 9/14 trials (p<0.001). Compared with
      mineral-treated ewes the mean difference was 2.8 kg pre-lambing (9/14 trials) and
      1.7 kg pre-weaning (6/14 trials). Lambs reared by treated ewes were heavier (mean
      1.55 kg) at weaning in 6/14 trials (p<0.001), but there was no effect of CRC
      treatment on total weight of lambs weaned per ewe (p=0.507). Variation in weight 
      of lamb weaned per ewe was largely explained by differences in lamb survival from
      birth to weaning (p<0.001), with no effect of CRC treatment (p>0.65). Treatment
      of ewes with a CRC at pregnancy scanning was neither better nor worse than a
      pre-lambing treatment (p=0.065). There was no difference in the response from
      treatment with either of the two CRC or moxidectin. Treatment with short-acting
      oral anthelmintics resulted in no consistent benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Anthelmintic
      treatments administered to ewes around lambing resulted in variable responses
      between farms and years, which in some trials were negative for some variables,
      and some of the variability was due to the mineral component of the CRC. The
      widespread perception amongst farmers and veterinarians that anthelmintic
      treatment of ewes around lambing will always result in positive benefits is not
      supported.

PG  - 531-41

AB  - Small-scale urban dairy farms (n = 16) in and around Jimma, Ethiopia with
      cross-bred (Bos indicus x Bos taurus) cows were enrolled in a double-blinded
      intervention study to investigate the effect of a trace element supplementation
      programme on trace element status and milk concentrations as well as performance 
      [body condition score (BCS), milk yield, leptin], milk composition, antioxidant
      status (ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), thiobarbituric acid-reactive
      substances (TBARS)], blood biochemistry, serum proteins and immune response
      (antibody titre upon rabies vaccination). The farms were allocated to a (1)
      placebo or (2) Cu, Zn, Se, Co and I supplementation treatment for 150 d. On days 
      0 and 120, four lactating cows per farm were sampled for milk and plasma, and on 
      day 150 for serum, following primo-vaccination. Cu deficiency was present in 17% 
      and marginal Se deficiency in 30% of initially sampled cows, while no Zn shortage
      was detected. Over 120 days, trace element supplementation caused a bigger
      increase in plasma Se and Cu concentrations, but also a larger decrease of plasma
      Fe concentrations. A larger increase in milk Se concentrations was observed in
      the supplemented group, whereas none of the other elements were affected. BCS
      decreased more over time in the supplemented group. None of the other parameters 
      of performance and antioxidant status nor milk composition or blood biochemistry 
      was affected by treatment. Antibody response to rabies vaccination did not differ
      between groups, whereas alpha1-globulins tended to be lower and beta-globulins
      tended to be higher in the supplemented group. In conclusion, despite improved Cu
      and Se status and Se concentrations in milk, cows on tropical urban dairy farms
      did not seem to benefit from trace element supplementation, with respect to the
      parameters investigated.

TI  - Oral Vaccination of Channel Catfish against Enteric Septicemia of Catfish Using a
      Live Attenuated Edwardsiella ictaluri Isolate.
PG  - 135-43
LID - 10.1080/08997659.2015.1032440 [doi]
AB  - Enteric septicemia of catfish (ESC), caused by Edwardsiella ictaluri, is the most
      problematic bacterial disease affecting catfish aquaculture in the southeastern
      United States. Efforts to develop an effective ESC vaccine have had limited
      industrial success. In commercial settings, ESC vaccines are typically
      administered by immersion when fry are transferred from the hatchery to rearing
      ponds. While this approach is a practical method of mass delivery, this strategy 
      administers vaccines to very young fish, which lack a fully developed immune
      system. To circumvent this limitation, an oral vaccination strategy was evaluated
      as a means of immunizing catfish at the fingerling stage of production, when fish
      possess a more complete immune arsenal. A virulent E. ictaluri isolate (S97-773) 
      was attenuated by successive passage on media containing increasing
      concentrations of rifamycin. In laboratory trials, cultured vaccine was diluted
      and mixed with feed (100 mL diluted vaccine/454 g feed). This mixture was then
      fed to Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus fingerlings. Two separate dilutions of
      cultured vaccine (1:10 and 1:100) were used to create the vaccine-feed mixture,
      equating to estimated doses of 5 x 10(7) and 5 x 10(6) CFU/g of feed,
      respectively. After 30 d, catfish were exposed by immersion (1 x 10(6) CFU/mL) to
      the virulent parental strain of E. ictaluri. The target dose (1:100 dilution,
      approximately 5 x 10(6) CFU/g of feed) offered exceptional protection (relative
      percent survival = 82.6-100%). In addition, negligible deaths occurred in fish
      vaccinated at 10 times the target dose (1:10 dilution, approximately 5 x 10(7)
      CFU/g of feed). In pond trials, antibody production increased 18-fold in orally
      vaccinated fish. When compared with nonvaccinated controls, vaccination
      significantly improved survival, feed fed, feed conversion, biomass produced, and
      total harvest. This research demonstrates Channel Catfish can be successfully
      immunized in a commercial setting against E. ictaluri with a single dose of an
      orally delivered, live attenuated, E. ictaluri vaccine.

      disease in pet rabbits.
PG  - 377-82
LID - 10.1111/jsap.12346 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of four rabbit diets (hay only; extruded diet
      with hay; muesli with hay; muesli only) on length and curvature of cheek teeth
      and eruption and attrition rates of incisors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two
      Dutch rabbits, randomly divided into four diet groups, had length and saggital
      plane curvature of the first cheek teeth measured radiographically at 1, 9 and 17
      months. Eruption/attrition of the left upper incisor was directly measured at
      weeks 30, 32 and 35. RESULTS: Eruption rates matched attrition rates in all
      groups, but were higher in the hay only group than in both groups fed muesli. By 
      month 9, a greater degree of tooth curvature was present in rabbits fed muesli
      only than in those fed hay only and extruded diet with hay. After 17 months,
      rabbits fed muesli only and muesli with hay had longer lower first cheek teeth
      and larger interdental spaces between the first two molars than rabbits fed
      extruded diet and hay and hay only. Three rabbits fed muesli only developed
      evidence of dental disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Presence of increased tooth
      length, curvature and interdental spaces indicated early dental pathology in
      rabbits fed muesli. Muesli diets cannot be recommended for pet rabbits.

TI  - LA sprouts randomized controlled nutrition and gardening program reduces obesity 
      and metabolic risk in Latino youth.
PG  - 1244-51
LID - 10.1002/oby.21077 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a 12-week gardening, nutrition, and cooking
      intervention ("LA Sprouts") on dietary intake, obesity parameters, and metabolic 
      disease risk among low-income, primarily Hispanic/Latino youth in Los Angeles.
      METHODS: The randomized controlled trial involved four elementary schools [two
      schools randomized to intervention (172 third-through fifth-grade students); two 
      schools randomized to control (147 third-through fifth-grade students)]. Classes 
      were taught in 90-minute sessions once a week to each grade level for 12 weeks.
      Data collected at pre- and postintervention included dietary intake via food
      frequency questionnaire (FFQ), anthropometric measures [BMI, waist circumference 
      (WC)], body fat, and fasting blood samples. RESULTS: LA Sprouts participants had 
      significantly greater reductions in BMI z-scores (0.1-vs. 0.04-point decrease,
      respectively; P = 0.01) and WC (-1.2 cm vs. no change; P < 0.001). Fewer LA
      Sprouts participants had the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) after the intervention
      than before, while the number of controls with MetSyn increased. LA Sprouts
      participants had improvements in dietary fiber intake (+3.5% vs. -15.5%; P =
      0.04) and less decreases in vegetable intake (-3.6% vs. -26.4%; P = 0.04). Change
      in fruit intake before and after the intervention did not significantly differ
      between LA Sprouts and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: LA Sprouts was effective in
      reducing obesity and metabolic risk.

AB  - A study was conducted during hot season to determine the effect of
      synchronization of ovulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on fertility
      of lactating dairy cows with ovarian cysts. Non cyclic Holstein dairy cows (n =
      80) were stratified by parity and diagnosed as having an ovarian cyst. The cows
      were further identified as follicular or luteal cysts according to the plasma
      progesterone (P4) concentration and the cystic image of ultrasonography. Cystic
      cows were randomly assigned to receive treatments (Ovsynch as the control or
      Ovsynch plus 3000 IU hCG). All cows were artificially inseminated at 16-18 h
      after the second gonadotropin releasing hormone injection. Cows supplemented with
      hCG had a greater number of corpus luteum (1.8 +/- 0.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.3; P < 0.05)
      and had greater P4 concentration on day 12 than those control cows (6.3 +/- 0.3
      and 3.9 +/- 0.4 ng/ml; P < 0.05). Concentration of cortisol did not differ
      between groups of cystic cows. No significant differences were found in overall
      conception rates between the treatments; however, significantly greater
      conception rate (P = 0.03) was observed in cows with luteal cysts receiving
      Ovsynch plus hCG. This study highlights that administration of hCG following the 
      Ovsynch-based timed artificial insemination (AI) is more effective than the
      control Ovsynch by which the hCG affects corpus luteum (CL) development, P4
      concentration, and thus improves conception rate in dairy cows with luteal cysts.

PG  - 903-8
LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0806-7 [doi]
AB  - An experiment was carried out to determine the effect of four local energy
      sources (sorghum grain, green banana, polished rice, and sugarcane molasses) fed 
      to dairy cows on intake, milk production and composition, and economic viability 
      in a silvopastoral system in Costa Rica (Turrialba). Twelve grazing cows (Jersey 
      x Central American Milking Creole), with a mean live weight of 332 kg (SD 34),
      were supplemented with 0.5 kg of dry matter (DM)/100 kg/LW of Erythrina
      porppigiana fresh foliage daily. Experimental design was a replicated change-over
      4 x 4 Latin Square. The pasture composition was 11 and 17 % of star grass
      (Cynodon niemfuensis), 32 and 28 % of ruzzi grass (Brachiaria rusisiensis), and
      45 and 42 % of natural grasses (Axonopus compresus and Paspalum conjugatum) at
      initial and final times of the essay, respectively. The grass allowance was 30.14
      DM/cow/day. Significant differences were found among treatments for variable milk
      fat content (P < 0.05). Sorghum presented the highest (41.2 g/kg milk) content of
      milk fat, followed by green banana (39.2 g/kg milk), polished rice (38.3 g/kg
      milk) and molasses (38.1 g/kg milk). Non-significant differences (P > 0.05)
      resulted for total milk production (sorghum 9.0 kg/cow/day; green banana 8.9
      kg/cow/day; polished rice 8.8 kg/cow/day; molasses 8.6 kg/cow/day) and
      fat-corrected milk (FCM). The financial analysis showed that all treatments were 
      economically viable; however, supplementation with green bananas and molasses
      were the most favorable due to the low costs incurred.

LID - 10.1007/s11250-015-0801-z [doi]
AB  - A study was conducted on 50 steers (183 +/- 4 kg initial body weight, 3 years of 
      age) to assess effects of days in feedlot on performance, carcass characteristics
      and meat quality of Tanzania shorthorn zebu (TSZ) cattle with the aim of
      determining appropriate finishing period. Periods were 0 day (P0), 25 days (P25),
      50 days (P50), 75 days (P75) and 100 days (P100) with 10 animals per period.
      Steers were housed in individual pens, fed with a concentrate diet and hay on an 
      ad libitum basis except the P0 group which was slaughtered at the beginning of
      trial. Long stay in feedlot, P100, increased concentrate dry matter intake by 2
      kg DM/day over short stay, P25. Final weight and total gain increased (P < 0.05) 
      from P25 (22.6 kg) to P100 steers (95.4 kg). Periods had no influence (P > 0.05) 
      on an average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) but affected
      carcass characteristics. Empty body weight (EBW) and hot carcass weight (HCW)
      increased by 61 and 65 %, respectively, from no feedlot, P0 to P100. Dressing
      percentage was high (P < 0.05) for P100 steers. Carcass measurements, internal
      fat, fat thickness and carcass total fat were the highest (P < 0.05) on P100
      steers and the lowest on P0 steers. Rate of pH decline increased with days in
      feedlot, while cooking loss and shear force values decreased in advanced ageing
      time. Feedlot periods of 75 and 100 days resulted into high intake, carcass
      measurements and tenderness, but 100 days further increased carcass fatness and
      fat thickness levels, thus, with this particular feeding system and animal's
      condition, 75 days is the recommended period to finish TSZ cattle in feedlots.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate the partial replacement of soybean
      meal (SBM) for wet brewer's grains (WBG) or urea on the performance of lactating 
      dairy cows. The second investigated whether WBG ensiled with corn kept animal
      performance in low- and high-producing dairy cows compared with WBG. In
      experiment I, 40 Holstein cows were used in 4 x 4 Latin square design. The
      treatments comprised WBG or urea as partial replacement for SBM, as follows:
      control (diet based on SBM and 1 % of urea), 10 % of WBG, 20 % of WBG, and 2 % of
      urea. Dry matter intake (DMI) was not affected by treatments. WBG increased milk 
      yield linearly, but it decreased with urea. Milk fat content responded
      quadratically to WBG levels. Milk protein content decreased, while plasma urea
      nitrogen increased with high urea addition. In experiment II, 42 Holstein cows
      were divided into two groups according to production levels. Eighteen cows
      composed the group of low producing, while the high-producing group comprised 24 
      cows. The experimental design was a crossover with two periods of 14 days. The
      experimental treatments consisted of feeding WBG or WBG ensiled with ground corn.
      Regardless of the production level, no difference in milk yield and milk
      composition between treatments was observed.

TI  - The effect of dietary arachidonic acid (ARA) on growth performance, fatty acid
      composition and expression of ARA metabolism-related genes in larval half-smooth 
      tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis).
PG  - 1518-30
LID - 10.1017/S0007114515000781 [doi]
AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary arachidonic
      acid (ARA) on growth performance, fatty acid composition and ARA
      metabolism-related gene expression in larval half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus
      semilaevis). Larvae (35 d after hatching, 54 (SEM 1) mg) were fed diets with
      graded concentrations of ARA (0.01, 0.39, 0.70, 1.07, 1.42 and 2.86 % dry weight)
      five times per d to apparent satiation for 30 d. Results showed that increased
      dietary ARA concentration caused a significant non-linear rise to a plateau in
      survival rate, final body weight and thermal growth coefficient, and the maximum 
      values occurred with the 1.42 % ARA treatment. As dietary ARA increased to 1.07
      or 1.42 %, activities of trypsin, leucine aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase
      levels increased, but they decreased with higher ARA concentrations. The fatty
      acid composition of tongue sole larvae was almost well correlated with their
      dietary fatty acid profiles, and the EPA content of the larvae decreased with
      increasing dietary ARA. Meanwhile, the partial sequences of COX-1a
      (cyclo-oxygenase-1a), COX-1b (cyclo-oxygenase-1b), COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2),
      5-LOX (5-lipoxygenase) and CYP2J6-like (cytochrome P450 2J6-like) were also
      obtained. Both COX-2 and 5-LOX mRNA expression levels significantly increased to 
      a plateau in an 'L'-shaped manner as dietary ARA increased to 1.07 or 1.42 %, but
      no significant differences were found in the gene expression of COX-1a, COX-1b or
      CYP2J6-like. These results suggest that 1.07-1.42 % dietary ARA was beneficial to
      the growth performance of larval tongue sole, and the regulation of dietary ARA
      on the growth performance of larvae was probably involved in altering the mRNA
      expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX.

      piglets.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1186/s12917-015-0425-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early weaning (EW) results in a transient period of impaired
      integrity of the intestinal mucosa that may be associated with reduced plasma
      concentration of glucagon-like peptide-(GLP) 2. We have previously shown that
      intragastric infusion of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) increases circulating GLP-2 
      in early-weaned piglets. The aim of this study was to expand previous work to
      establish whether feeding piglets a cereal-based diet supplemented with CDC can
      improve gut integrity and animal performance immediately after EW. A cohort of 36
      piglets weaned at 20 days of age, 6.2 +/- 0.34 kg of body weight (BW) were
      randomly assigned (n = 18) to receive a standard prestarter diet or the same diet
      supplemented with 60 mg of CDC per kg of initial BW for ad libitum intake until
      day 14 postweaning. Thereafter, all pigs were fed the same untreated starter diet
      for 21 days until the end of the study on day 35. On days 1, 7 and 14 blood
      samples were collected from 6 pigs per treatment to measure plasma GLP-2. On day 
      15, 6 pigs per treatment were euthanized to obtain intestinal tissue samples for 
      later histological and gene expression analyses. RESULTS: Supplementing the diet 
      with CDC tended to increase plasma GLP-2 (P < 0.07; 39 %) and the weight of the
      large intestine (P < 0.10; 11 %), and increased ileal crypt depth (P < 0.04; 15
      %) after 14 days of treatment exposure. Although feed intake and BW gain were not
      affected by treatments, feeding CDC induced the expression of the cytokines
      TNF-alpha (P < 0.02; 1.9 fold), IL-6 (P < 0.01; 2.4 fold), and IL-10 (P < 0.006; 
      2.2 fold) and the tight junctional protein ZON-1 (P < 0.02; 1.5 fold) in the
      distal small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the oral
      administration of CDC to early-weaned pigs has the potential to improve the
      protection of the intestinal mucosa independently of relevant changes in gut
      growth.

AB  - Latino children experience higher rates of obesity than do non-Latino white
      children. Family-centered nutrition interventions can slow the rate of weight
      gain in this population. Ninos Sanos, Familia Sana (Healthy Children, Healthy
      Family) is a 5-year, community-based, participatory research study that targets
      rural Mexican-origin farmworker families with children aged 2 to 8 years in
      California's Central Valley. Adaptation of a culturally relevant obesity
      prevention program involved qualitative research to tailor key obesity prevention
      messages, pilot testing and implementation of key messages and activities at
      family nights, and continual modification to incorporate culturally innovative
      elements. Of the 238 families enrolled, 53% (125) attended the recommended
      minimum of 5 (of 10 possible) classes during the first year. A university and
      community partnership can guide development of a culturally tailored obesity
      prevention program that is suitable for reaching a high-risk Mexican-origin
      audience through cooperative extension and other public health programs.
